# We the Oncetold!

We're a podcasting company proving that you don’t have to be a big to have a big impact. From creating our own podcasts, inventing better ways to produce a show, giving influential talks at Podfest, to running a remote company that takes the friction out of producting a podcast; we make waves and build great podcasts while we do it.

# We're Big on sharing

We've built sharing into our DNA. We've given hundreds of talks -- from Meetups to Podfest -- that are packed with the lessons we've learned from stepping up to the mic. We produce a popular podcast called PODWRECKED that focuses on better ways to create a podcast. By producing our own podcasts ABOUT podcasting we have eaten our own dog food, experienced the struggles most podcasters will face, and have survived to tell the tale.

# We're podcasters too!

We're podcasters who had enough of software designed by audio engineers. That's why Oncetold is a podcasting company that has doubled down on simple and straightforward. As big believers in the power of keeping it simple we're betting that making podcating easier for you will pay off. That's why we only give you what you need to connect your audience to your podcast and make big bets on simplicity, clarity, ease-of-use, and honest. This goes for our products, our publications, and our company.

# We Love JAMStack (on Toast)

If you run in tech circles, you've surely heard of JAMStack (JavaScript, API, and Markup). The Jamstack ecosystem at Oncetold has made us faster, more secure, and easier to scale. Today, JAMStack is as vibrant as ever, and because it is built into the heart of Oncetold, many JAMStack modern innovations start as our own internal experiements.

# Investing in things that don’t go out of style

The best business advice we ever got is from Jeff Bezos from Amazon.com. He told us "Find the things that won't change in your business and invest heavily in those things." So what are those things for us? 10 years from now people aren't going to say "I wish Oncetold was harder to use" or "I wish Oncetold was slower and less reliable" or "I wish it took longer to get an answer from someone at Oncetold", so we invest heavily in infrastructure, great design, and customer service. We don’t chase fads and trends, we stay focused on the things that will always be important.

# Giving a damn

Treating people right is fundamental to how we do business. We treat our customers as we'd want to be treated, we treat each other like family, and we treat ourselves to a good day's work and a good night's sleep. Our goals have always been the same: Have fun, do exceptional work, build the best product in the business, experiment, pay attention to the details, treat people right, tell the truth, have a positive impact on the world around us, give back, and keep learning.

We're also big believers in business 101. We don't spend more than we earn, we don't waste money on things that don't matter, we don't give away everything for free and hope we'll figure it out before we run out of cash. We're in business to stay in business.

# Always at your service

If you have a general question for us, just drop us an email at howdy@oncetold.us and we’ll get back to you within a day. If you're a customer, and you want to talk to someone in customer service, drop an email to support@oncetold.us and we'll get back to you right away. We love sharing our ideas on business, culture, design, and technology with the world.

# Oncetold Bill of Rights

OnceTold believes in creating an podcasting environment in which there is an open marketplace of ideas is the only way forward towards greater freedom.

OnceTold is commited to building a platform of Free Speach exercised through the creation, publication, and sharing of podcasts.

OnceTold believes that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

OnceTold enforces the removal of content based on a few narrow categories of speech. These categories include obscenity, child pornography, defamatory speech, false advertising, true threats, and fighting words.

OnceTold understands that there is a distinction between free speech and harassment or incitement to commit acts of violence, but an individual who is simply expressing their opinion on a topic or criticizing government policy in a podcast is not committing any act of violence.
