    <p><strong>Ep.09: Evolutionary Bottleneck</strong></p>
    <p><br />Howdy, Ya'll! ðŸ¤ â˜•</p>
    <p>
      Today, I had to put myself in someone else's shoes after getting into a
      big argument with a best friend and realizing that I was the one in the
      wrong. What do about it? You do the only thing you can do, you ask for
      forgiveness! That is the lesson for today -- if something is bothering you
      don't keep it inside. Talk about it now! Second, if you do get into a
      fight and say something dumb it's not the end of the world. Once the hurt
      feelings calm down you can work it out but only if you realize that the
      only person you can control is YOU! Finally, and most importantly, when
      you do mess up (and you will), try saying you're sorry. It goes a long
      way.

    <p><br /><strong>About Flowgnar</strong></p>
    <p>
      Flowgnar, hosted by Kyle M. Bondo, is a music podcast for outdoor
      enthusiasts who need a soundtrack for their next adventure. It features a
      curated playlist of Valueverse artists that turn garage band-like beats
      into pure endurance fuel.
    </p>
    <p><br /><strong>Trail Tested Playlist</strong></p>
    <p>
      Each playlist has been personally trail tested by Kyle on his mountain
      bike -- a 2019 Kona HeiHei CR/DL called Chickensaurus-Rex -- to flow you
      through 10 miles of Texas heat, rock, and gnar. It should be good enough
      for 5 miles of trail running or a good 3-mile hike too. Embrace the flow
      while you chew the gnar! Learn more at
