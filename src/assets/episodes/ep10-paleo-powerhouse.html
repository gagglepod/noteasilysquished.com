    <p><strong>Ep.10: Paleo Powerhouse</strong></p>
    <p><br />Howdy, Ya'll! ðŸ¤ â˜•</p>
    <p>
      Today is one of those days where I didn't want to go outside. I wanted to
      stay inside, eat junk food, and watch YouTube all day. But if I skip
      Monday's ride, I'll most likely skip Tuesday's ride too. Then, before you
      know it, I've skipped half the week and now it's Thursday! Geesh! This is
      the theme of today's mix: doing it even when you don't want to. I get that
      you need to listen to your body and rest when it needs it. However, I've
      found that my body -- and those dark voices in my head -- can trick you
      into believing you need rest when what you really need is to hit the trail
      and knock the dirt off your dinosaur bones! So, that's what I'm going to
      do today. I'm going to go ride even though I don't want to. Are you with
      me? Then let's get this Paleo Powerhouse moving. Go, go, GO!

    <p><br /><strong>Trail Tested Playlist</strong></p>
    <p>
      I have personally trail-tested each of my playlists on my mountain bike --
      a 2019 Kona HeiHei CR/DL called Chickensaurus-Rex -- to flow you through
      10 miles of Texas heat, rock, and gnar. Then again on foot with Salomon
      Speedcross 6 trail shoes to make sure it can hold up to a good 5-mile
      trail running. Then I got in a good 3-mile ruck hike with 30 lbs of added
      weight to triple down on a playlist that has been certified to keep you
      moving. This is the Flowgnar Guarantee: If you embrace the flow, I will
      give you tunes to help you chew the gnar! Only on Flowgnar!
