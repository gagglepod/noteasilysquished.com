      Kyle M. Bondo, is a music podcast for outdoor enthusiasts who need a

    <h2>Trail Tested Playlist</h2>
    <p>
      Each playlist has been personally trail tested by Kyle on his mountain
      bike -- a 2019 Kona HeiHei CR/DL called Chickensaurus-Rex -- to flow you
      through 10 miles of Texas heat, rock, and gnar. It should be good enough
      for 5 miles of trail running or a good 3-mile hike too. Embrace the flow
      while you chew the gnar! Learn more at
