# Episode 00

He thinks I'm a charlatan, my Dear. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. We're fallin' through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go... So these are my replacements. A dandy and a clown. ...history sometimes gives us a terrible shock, and that is because we don't quite fully understand. Why should we? After all, we're too small to realize its final pattern. Therefore, don't try and judge it from where you stand.

Obviously, the Time Lords have programmed the TARDIS always to return to Earth. It seems that I am some kind of a galactic yo-yo! Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. No sir. Thirteen! Do you wanna come with me? 'Cause if you do, then I should warn you â€” you're gonna see all sorts of things. Ghosts from the past. Aliens from the future. The day the Earth died in a ball of flame. It won't be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be calm. But I'll tell you what it will be: The trip of a lifetime!
