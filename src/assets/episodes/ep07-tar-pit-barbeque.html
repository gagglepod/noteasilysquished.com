    <p><strong>Ep.06: Mesozoic Life Crisis</strong></p>
    <p><br />Howdy, Ya'll! ðŸ¤ â˜•</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to Flowgnar Episode #6 -- <strong>Mesozoic Life Crisis</strong>! I
      am your Summer Time trail guide Kyle M. Bondo, coming to you from The
      Valley of the Dinosaurs -- Glen Rose, Texas. Today marks the last week of
      Summer! Oh, no! August here in Texas has been hot, hot, hot! But strangely
      not as hot as last year. To quote The Hives: A time was invented to keep
      the kids in the hall, they gave it a name and we all know it is 'Fall'.
      But that's just the line of the story that I have presented: Fall is just
      something that grown-ups invented! That is my Parking Lot wisdom for you
      today. Just because it's Fall doesn't mean it is the end of your
      adventures. So take this curated playlist of Valueverse artists and
      tortured dinosaur metaphors and get moving. Go, go, GO!

    <p><br /><strong>About Flowgnar</strong></p>
    <p>
      Flowgnar, hosted by Kyle M. Bondo, is a music podcast for outdoor
      enthusiasts who need a soundtrack for their next adventure. It features a
      curated playlist of Valueverse artists that turn garage band-like beats
      into pure endurance fuel.
    </p>
    <p><br /><strong>Trail Tested Playlist</strong></p>
    <p>
      Each playlist has been personally trail tested by Kyle on his mountain
      bike -- a 2019 Kona HeiHei CR/DL called Chickensaurus-Rex -- to flow you
      through 10 miles of Texas heat, rock, and gnar. It should be good enough
      for 5 miles of trail running or a good 3-mile hike too. Embrace the flow
      while you chew the gnar! Learn more at
