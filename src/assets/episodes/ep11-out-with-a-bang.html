    <p><strong>Ep.11: Out With a Bang</strong></p>
    <p><br />Howdy, Ya'll! ðŸ¤ â˜•ðŸŒ </p>
    <p>
      Today, here in the Valley of the Dinos it's the Election Eve before the
      most important election in our lifetime -- or so they keep saying. This is
      when we, as Americans, leave milk and cookies out for Captain America
      before getting a rough and restless night of insomnia followed by going to
      the polls tomorrow. I'm not going to tell you who to vote for because you
      already know who you need to vote for. Instead, I've created an Election
      Mix that you can use while you wait your turn in line. I made it special
      with limited interruptions so that you can get a 30-minute power session
      in right before you go into the booth or drown out the smelly hippy
      standing next to you in line. Heck, you could even ride your mountain bike
      down to the city center and make a day of it. But here's to you, fellow
      American! Mr. Murphy and I salute you. Now, go make Uncle Sam proud!

    <p><br /><strong>Trail Tested Playlist</strong></p>
    <p>
      I have personally trail-tested each of my playlists on my mountain bike --
      a 2019 Kona HeiHei CR/DL called Chickensaurus-Rex -- to flow you through
      10 miles of Texas heat, rock, and gnar. Then again on foot with Salomon
      Speedcross 6 trail shoes to make sure it can hold up to a good 5-mile
      trail running. Then I got in a good 3-mile ruck hike with 30 lbs of added
      weight to triple down on a playlist that has been certified to keep you
      moving. This is the Flowgnar Guarantee: If you embrace the flow, I will
      give you tunes to help you chew the gnar! Only on Flowgnar!
