    <p><strong>Ep.12: Amber Pitch Slap</strong></p>
    <p><br />Howdy, Ya'll! ðŸ¤ â˜•ðŸŒ </p>
    <p>
      Today, I'm trying hard to be whoever I am supposed to be but it has been
      rough since a spook broke on my rear wheel. Who am I if I can't ride my
      mountain bike?
    </p>
    <p>
      That's right, my faithful steed, Chickensaurus-Rex broke my heart
      yesterday. Or it was that diabolical bike shop in Fort Worth that
      installed an inferior part. Who's to know? What I am now -- is grounded.
      Nothing more than a feeble, ground-pounding peasant. LOL! Just kidding. I
      started this journey hiking, then trail running, then doing that half
      hike-half run shuffle we call trekking in adventure racing. And then
      settled on rucking which is hiking with 30-60 lbs of weight for 4 miles or
      so -- for fun! But this broken spook mix goes out to my true love --
      mountain biking -- who will always have a place in my heart. Forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      HA! Who am I kidding? Chickensaurus-Rex goes into the shop today and will
      be fixed by Monday! She lives to ride again!! Later suckers!! (No worries
      -- I still love my shoe and boot people!) Go, go, GO!

    <p><br /><strong>Trail Tested Playlist</strong></p>
    <p>
      I have personally trail-tested each of my playlists on my mountain bike --
      a 2019 Kona HeiHei CR/DL called Chickensaurus-Rex -- to flow you through
      10 miles of Texas heat, rock, and gnar. Then again on foot with Salomon
      Speedcross 6 trail shoes to make sure it can hold up to a good 5-mile
      trail running. Then I got in a good 3-mile ruck hike with 30 lbs of added
      weight to triple down on a playlist that has been certified to keep you
      moving. This is the Flowgnar Guarantee: If you embrace the flow, I will
      give you tunes to help you chew the gnar! Only on Flowgnar!
