    <p><strong>Ep.08: Big Toothy Grin</strong></p>
    <p><br />Howdy, Ya'll! ðŸ¤ â˜•</p>
    <p>
      Today, I'm reminded of what Marcus Aurelius said about dwelling on
      problems: "Your days are numbered, and if you don't clear the clouds from
      your mind now you may never have another chance." What does that mean? You
      cannot dwell on failures and be dissatisfied with today because you may
      not have a tomorrow. You have to live your life as if every moment were
      your last. In other words, be thankful for today because tomorrow is not
      guaranteed. So if you woke up on this side of the dirt today I want you to
      put on your Big Toothy Grin and remind yourself to let that stuff go and
      get back to living in the moment. Are you with me? Then let's let that
      stuff go and get to it.

    <p><br /><strong>About Flowgnar</strong></p>
    <p>
      Flowgnar, hosted by Kyle M. Bondo, is a music podcast for outdoor
      enthusiasts who need a soundtrack for their next adventure. It features a
      curated playlist of Valueverse artists that turn garage band-like beats
      into pure endurance fuel.
    </p>
    <p><br /><strong>Trail Tested Playlist</strong></p>
    <p>
      Each playlist has been personally trail tested by Kyle on his mountain
      bike -- a 2019 Kona HeiHei CR/DL called Chickensaurus-Rex -- to flow you
      through 10 miles of Texas heat, rock, and gnar. It should be good enough
      for 5 miles of trail running or a good 3-mile hike too. Embrace the flow
      while you chew the gnar! Learn more at
