      Ya'll! ðŸ¤ â˜•
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to Flowgnar Episode #4 -- <strong>Fossil Fuel Injector</strong>! I
      am your Summer Time trail guide Kyle M. Bondo, coming to you from The
      Valley of the Dinosaurs -- Glen Rose, Texas. Today marks the last month of
      Summer and I just celebrated a birthday in July. This makes August the
      grand finale to my Month-Long Birthday Celebration! I love a good July and
      August, especially when you get to live to see the next one. That is my
      Parking Lot wisdom for you today. Your birthday is the best day to go on
      an adventure and take this curated playlist of Valueverse artists and
      tortured dinosaur metaphors with you on the journey. Go, go, GO!

    <p>About Flowgnar</p>
    <p>
      Flowgnar, hosted by Kyle M. Bondo, is a music podcast for outdoor
      enthusiasts who need a soundtrack for their next adventure. It features a
      curated playlist of Valueverse artists that turn garage band-like beats
      into pure endurance fuel.
    </p>
    <p>Trail Tested Playlist</p>
    <p>
      Each playlist has been personally trail tested by Kyle on his mountain
      bike -- a 2019 Kona HeiHei CR/DL called Chickensaurus-Rex -- to flow you
      through 10 miles of Texas heat, rock, and gnar. It should be good enough
      for 5 miles of trail running or a good 3-mile hike too. Embrace the flow
      while you chew the gnar! Learn more at
