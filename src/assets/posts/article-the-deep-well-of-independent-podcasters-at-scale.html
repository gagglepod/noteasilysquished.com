    <title>The deep well of independent podcasters at scale</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      There are many companies out there that have a new product with no one
      ready to buy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, they have a marketing arm full of salespeople ready to flood the
      world with their copy: Please buy X! This is the on-ramp to customer
      acquisition that so many startups and innovators have to go through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for small businesses, that team of marketers is usually one
      person. Worse yet, sales are not that persons full-time gig! It is just
      one of a hundred other gigs they have to do in any given day.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Old Thinking</strong></p>
    <p>
      So what is a company to do with this new product when creating an audience
      is both costly and time-consuming? Furthermore, what is a company to do
      when their tiny product team has spent every waking moment
      <em>building</em> the product and spent zero time advertising or marketing
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like you to consider this very underused strategy: sponsorships.
      But not just any kind of sponsorships, but the sponsorship of a very
      specific kind. The sponsorship of podcasting events. You might be thinking
      as many other companies think about events. They look at events as a
      loss-leader. They know that spending money on a vendor booth will cost
      them. They know that sending knowledgeable staff to the event will also
      cost them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After crunching the numbers they will come up with a formula that will
      give them a dollar amount that will represent:
        <ul>
            <li>How much a new customer acquisition will cost me, and</li>
            <li>How many new customers I will need to acquire at this event, to</li>
            <li>Make it worth my while</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In business words, this is called ROI - Return on Investment. If I sink,
      let's say $5,000 into an event, then I need to get
      <em>at least</em> $5,000 worth of sales from it. They would like to double
      or triple that number — or in startup land speak they would like to 10x
      that baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      If that company becomes a sponsor of the event, they really need to have
      an advantageous position. 
    </p>
    <p>This could include being allowed to have one of
      their employees (usually the CEO or president of the company) come speak,
      their logo and branding all over the place, and reference to how grateful
      the event host is for having them defer the crazy costs of putting on a
      podcasting event in the first place. In fact, the more the sponsor gave
      the event organizer is directly proportional to how many times they are
      thanked during the event.
    </p>
    <p>Solve for X.</p>
    <p>
      What happens if the company puts out all this money and nobody buys their
      product? Sorry. That's the cost of doing business. Sometimes these events
      don't pan out and sometimes it takes two or three years worth of
      sponsorships before you see the needle move.
    </p>
    <p><strong>New Thinking</strong></p>
    <p>
      I've attended a few podcasting events such as
      <a href="https://podfestexpo.com/" target="_blank"
        >Podfest in Orlando, Florida</a
      >. At all of these events, you will find an assortment of companies, all
      pushing their various products complete with stickers, free t-shirts, and
      even stress balls. They are all trying to acquire new customers
      <em>at</em> the podcasting event. Why? Because they are marketing their
      products <em>TO</em> podcasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the one thing these companies are <em>not</em> doing is finding
      the potential audience that is right in front of their face. You see, a
      typical podcasting conference can range from 100 to 500 people. A large
      majority of podcasters are there to learn something new about podcasting
      but a strong majority of them are truly <em>wishing</em> they could make
      money with it too. 
    </p>
    <p>Few make that money but they all dream of one day
      quitting their meaningless jobs and becoming full-time podcasters. A
      typical company selling a product <em>to</em> podcasters sees the attendee
      as a customer. Just one customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see an attendee as a potential raving fan with an army of potential
      customers hiding under their podcasting hood!
    </p>
    <p>
      Open your mind and follow me down this rabbit hole for a moment. Your
      company wants to sell a product and needs staff to get that product in
      front of as many people as possible for as long as possible. Now think
      about how much that staff will cost you. 
    </p>
    <p>Pretend it's 5 college grads with
      an annual salary of $30,000 each. That will cost you — in salary alone —
      $150,000 for one year. Your expectations will be that they sell at least
      that much in products in the same year. If they don't? Well, doom on them.
    </p>
    <p>With me so far? Good!</p>
    <p>
      Now, look at that hungry podcaster over there who you only see as one
      customer. That podcaster is talking to at least 30-100 people a week — FOR
      FREE! There are no one-size-fits-all podcasters so each one has a
      different audience size. But for the sake of argument, let's say the
      average podcaster has an audience size of 200 weekly listeners. That is
      200 people — potential customers — tuning in to that one podcaster every
      week. Chances are, that podcaster has NEVER had an advertisement on their
      podcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? Because they have NEVER had an advertiser consider them worthy of
      one!
    </p>
    <p><strong>Approaching an Independent Podcaster</strong></p>
    <p>
      Here's what happens when you look right at a podcaster you meet at a
      podcasting conference and ask them if you would like to advertise your
      product:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, they freak out! Nobody has ever given care about their little
      podcast long enough to give them this opportunity so they are both excited
      and humbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, they suddenly become a fan of your product. They may have liked it
      before this, but now they have a renewed interest in giving you the best
      light possible to as many people that will listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, they will never ask for too much to promote your product. Why?
      Because “they don't know what to ask for.” Remember the first point? No
      advertiser has ever cared enough to give them the time of day so they are
      very new at this entire process.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you find a podcaster like this and have vetted them enough to know
      they're not a whack-a-doodle, you can do something that few companies will
      do: you can negotiate a very low cost compared to how much your product
      will be promoted. 
    </p>
    <p>The funny thing about podcasters is that they all have
      media hosting costs, gear expenses, SaaS tool subscription fees, website
      costs, and time investment costs. They also have mortgages, car payments,
      and smartphone bills too. As a small company, you can turn one good
      independent podcasters into a marketing machine for as little as $100 per
      episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now consider this calculus when thinking about hiring a marketing team.
      One good podcaster with a weekly audience of 200 will tell that audience
      about your product 52 times in one year. 
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, that podcaster will
      tell their friends, family, social media, and fellow podcasters about how
      you took a chance on them about 10x that number. 
    </p>
    <p>Plus, their audience will
      ebb and flow as they produce their show. The better they get at
      podcasting, the bigger audience they could attract. Now your $100 per
      episode ad just grew without any change in the price.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one podcasters you turn one customer into an entire street team of
      marketers for a fraction of the cost. As you grow your stable of
      podcasters you can start doing other cool things like A/B testing,
      specialize affiliate links that will show you which podcaster is doing
      more for you, and if your podcast ads are bringing in sales. 
    </p>
    <p>Unlike
      magazines, pay per click advertising, or even social media ads, you have
      real people connecting with other real people in a way that ads legitimacy
      to your company.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are so many good yet hungry podcasters out there with so many small
      companies ignoring them and their potential.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Take This One Step Further</strong></p>
    <p>
      You may ask yourself, <em>“Where do I find these podcasters?”</em> And
      that is where the Podcasting Conference is your treasure trove of
      recruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      A podcasting conference is a community of podcasters just waiting to be
      discovered by your company. They are there to hone their skills, share
      tips and tricks with each other, and learn something new. That makes them
      the perfect candidates for this strategy. 
    </p>
    <p>Finding a podcaster with a small
      yet loyal audience is one thing, but finding a podcaster that cares enough
      about their show to continually make it better, is the attitude you want.
      Podcasters are content creators. The better their content creation, the
      bigger their audience can get.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, many podcasting conferences have speakers who are teaching
      podcasting skills to attendees. 99-percent of these speakers are doing
      this for free. They've amassed enough podcasting knowledge to turn their
      own podcast experience into a teaching tool or even a real business. 
    </p>
    <p>These
      podcasters are in it for all the marbles which is what you want in an
      advertising partner. You don't want to have a podcaster accept your money
      only to fold shop the next day. 
    </p>
    <p>By looking hard at podcasters that spend
      enough time to create a conference talk you will find individuals that are
      trying to make a stable living with their <em>podcraft</em>. They are
      going to be your mustangs — the workhorses that will make every one of
      your advertising dollars count.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you're not at these podcasting conferences, you're missing out
      on the unique opportunities these independent media publishing companies
      called “podcasters” present. Every conference I've been two in the past 3
      years if full of either media hosting FOR podcasters, tools FOR
      podcasters, or some kind of service FOR podcasters. 
    </p>
    <p>Where are the small
      companies and startups looking to connect WITH podcasters TO market their
      products? Nowhere. They don't come. They don't sponsor events. Heck, they
      don't even know these conferences exist!
    </p>
    <p><strong>The Street Team Everyone is Ignoring</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Internet has changed everything. Instead of big media companies
      controlling all the channels, individuals control what content they want
      and when they want it. 
    </p>
    <p>When a TV commercial comes on, people look at their
      phones. When an ad plays before you Youtube video, people wait for the
      5-seconds and press the skip its link. But podcasting? The numbers don't
      lie. Podcasting advertisements are more listened to, more engaging, and
      appeal to a far younger audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, all this marketing potential is being ignored when you don't even
      consider how a small $1,000, $2,500, or even a $5,000 sponsorship of a
      podcasting event could be your conduit to a podcasting audience in the
      tens-of-thousands. Not only would you be one of only a handful of
      companies that gave a care about helping the conference take place, but
      you would have 2-days of uninterrupted interviewing opportunities. 
    </p>
    <p>With
      that time you could meet, judge, vet and connect with dozens of podcasters
      with all sorts of topics and audiences. It could be just the punch in the
      arm your company needs to get off the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please understand that independent podcasters can smell bad intentions
      from a mile away. And if they don't believe in your product or are selling
      something smarmy, most of them will pass on you. But if you back your
      products with the same commitment and enthusiasm you show this small but
      powerful podcasting community, the ROI you can create will certainly make
      a dent in your bottom line.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the next time you think you need to hire a marketing team or have a
      new product that needs some love, consider how powerful yet cost-effective
      a podcaster partnership could be. We — independent podcasters — are all
      dreaming of being legitimized by having an advertiser. 
    </p>
    <p>We've spent years
      perfecting our shows, building a small but loyal following, and creating
      endless amounts of new and interesting content. You will be surprised how
      grateful we can be by having your company take an interest in what we've
      built.
