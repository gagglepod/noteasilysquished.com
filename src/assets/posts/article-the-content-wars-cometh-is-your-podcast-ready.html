    <title>The Content Wars Cometh: Is your podcast ready?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>There is a storm coming called <em>The Content Wars</em>.</p>
    <p>
      Not unlike

        >Marvel Secret Wars</a
      >, which changed Marvel comics forever (e.g. the true origin of
      Spidermanâ€™s black suit), the Content Wars are about to change the
      motivation behind why creators use podcasting, video, and live streaming
      to tell their stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first indications of this coming war have already started within the
      hallowed halls of movie and TV executive producer offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hollywood combed the depths of remakes from the 80s and 90s, then
      bought up every book option from Harry Potter to Twilight, they are in
      search of new stories to feed the insatiable beast called demand. They
      have already begun using podcasting and on-line video to prototype new TV
      and Movie content such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/homecoming" target="_blank"
          >Homecoming</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Lore-Season-1/dp/B074N8MFJ3"
          target="_blank"
          >Lore</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/dr-death/" target="_blank"
          >Dr. Death</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What is coming next is a tidal wave of intellectual property (IP)
      experimentation that will include known A/B/C level actors (who need to
      work) and new actors who can make a name for themselves with minimal
      studio financial risk. Audio Dramas such as

      from

      demonstrated how stars like Logan Browning (The Perfection), Mamoudou
      Athie (Jurassic World), Carla Gugino (Haunting of Hill House), Keith David
      (Greenleaf), and Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad) (to name a few) can be
      part of a studio project without the full-blown production costs of a film
      or TV series.
    </p>
    <p>
      A podcast costs a fraction of what a major motion picture or TV series
      would cost, allows new talent to get experience, and gauges audience
      reaction without the marketing investment. For a big Hollywood studio
      that's a winning formula!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, for content creators, executive production studios will need
      more stories to produce than ever before to feed this war. This is how a
      whole new cadre of podcasters, video storytellers, and even live streamer
      talent will have the opportunity to become their own showrunners, writers,
      and producers for REAL production companies that pay big money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, this will create a new door for audio drama and audio
      fiction podcast producers to enter the world of entertainment media by
      either sharing their original IP with the world or by selling the rights
      to their unique IP for millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this coming Content War will have its casualties when the
      content gold rush will make studios fight over content. The introduction
      of new podcast platforms (e.g. Amazon, Spotify) in combination with a big
      push into streaming services (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Discovery+, HBO
      Max) has already shown how desperate studios are to meet this demand. This
      means as the Content Wars heat up into a buying frenzy many of these new
      IPs and newfound talent will fall short.
    </p>
    <p>
      Companies will buy up the rights to individual podcasts, video series,
      streaming show ideas, online networks, and endless amounts of audio
      content â€” to include anything not nailed down or copyrighted â€” to make
      sure they get it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many podcasts, video creators, and live streamers are going to become very
      wealthy during this Content War bubble. But in the end, will lose their
      shows to the juggernaut that will sweep through our industry in search of
      the next best thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this Content War ends, who will be left standing? Will it have all
      been worth it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe those that have invested heavily into their show have a very
      good chance of seeing the Content Wars elevate their idea into a major IP
      that is remembered for decades. Yet, the only way any of us benefit from
      this is to have something of value ready to share with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your new story idea becomes more valuable than ever before, will you
      be ready? Is your show ready for the coming Content Wars?
    </p>
    <p>
      It better be!
