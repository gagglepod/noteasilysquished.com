        and enjoys them.‚Äù <br />-- Dan Martell, Buy Back Your Time</em

    </p>
    <p>
      TL:DR -- I won't bury the lead: you can podcast for under $100 a year!
    </p>
    <p>Don‚Äôt believe me?</p>
    <p>Here. I‚Äôll show you how.</p>
    <p>
      Starting with your idea, you can do all your design and prep work
      yourself. I assume you already have a laptop computer, which means you can
      download your recording software for free and even create your show art
      using free online graphics tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, your first expense comes when you buy a microphone that will get the
      job done ‚Äì say a $60 microphone that you can use with a USB connection.
    </p>
    <p>Good so far?</p>
    <p>
      Once you have everything downloaded and set up, you take your preparation
      work and use it to record your first podcast episode. When you like what
      you have you export it as an *.MP3.
    </p>
    <p>You‚Äôre halfway there!</p>
    <p>
      With one episode you need to host it. Again, you go to the Internet and
      find a cloud service that will give you a storage bucket like Google,
      Amazon, or Akamai. You place your MP3 in that storage bucket, make it
      public, and now the world can access it.
    </p>
    <p>If they only knew where it was.</p>
    <p>Wait! They can with your very own RSS feed!</p>
    <p>
      If you find the right documentation, you can then open up a text editor
      and create your very own RSS feed, fill in all the correct metadata tags,
      point your enclosure tag to the public location of your episode‚Äôs .MP3
      file, save it to your cloud storage bucket with the *.RSS file extension,
      and Bob‚Äôs your Uncle ‚Äì you have a podcast! The total of that Google
      storage bucket is somewhere in the neighborhood of free to $0.01 a month.
    </p>
    <p>Not bad.</p>
    <p>
      Now you need a website. With a quick search of domain names, you find the
      one that works for your podcast and register it for one year. If you go
      with a company like Namecheap, that domain name should cost you less than
      $15.
    </p>
    <p>Okay. We have around $25 left over for website hosting.</p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, we don‚Äôt need anything fancy like WordPress. With a little
      more research you can learn some simple tricks to building your first
      static website using JavaScript and HTML for free. Because it‚Äôs a static
      website you can host that site for free too. However, we‚Äôre going to need
      a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate (that‚Äôs the HTTPS that Google
      likes to see) so we might need a real website hosting plan. The good news
      is you can get it for less than $5.00 from companies like HostGator or
      Netlify. All you need to do now is register your podcast with all the big
      directories and wait for all the listeners to roll in.
    </p>
    <p>
      What‚Äôs the other $20 for? If your podcast gets popular, your storage
      bucket might get pricey and cost you upwards of $5.00 a month! That might
      be a nice problem to have. That extra money could also be used to buy
      coffee that you could use to create new episodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is essentially the path to build your own DIY podcast under $100.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you might be asking yourself, ‚ÄúSelf? Why don‚Äôt I just do podcasting
      myself and cut out the middleman?‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>Excellent question.</p>
    <p>
      The truth is you can. The reality is that it will require you to take some
      time to learn cloud architecture, software engineering, networking, web
      design, web development, and security, in addition to podcasting, audio
      editing, vocal skills, and researching your topics ‚Äì at a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>It only took me 20 years so I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get it in no time!</p>
    <p>And many of the lessons are not fun.</p>
    <p>
      Okay, all kidding aside, there is a lot of work that goes into the pancake
      batter and baling wire that holds the podcasting ecosystem together.
      Without a doubt, you can do everything in podcasting for pennies. However,
      you‚Äôre going to be bad at most of it for a long, long time without trading
      your time for a good amount of experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why many podcasters pay someone else to do most of the heavy
      lifting. They are trading their money for time. Yes, free software and
      services can get you into the game but they often lack features that would
      have saved you time. It is also true that you can host your own media
      files but you will most likely have to go up a steep learning curve just
      to save a few dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, all the technical tasks in podcasting are doable so long as you
      trade your time for understanding. After trying to do it all myself, I‚Äôve
      learned that some podcasting services are worth the money because they
      allow me to buy back some of my time. I pay for good audio editing
      software, media hosting, and remote recording tools. Everything else I do
      myself after trading my time for experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My advice is you should learn everything about how your podcast works
      first. Everything. Then, once you understand all its complexities, only
      pay for what you suck at or don‚Äôt enjoy doing.
    </p>
    <p>It will save you a lot of time.</p>
