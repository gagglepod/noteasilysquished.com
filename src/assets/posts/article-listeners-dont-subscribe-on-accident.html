    <p>Building an audience for your podcast is hard.</p>
    <p><em>Why is it hard?</em></p>
    <p>
      Because it requires constant vigilance, repeated processes, and continuous
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>In other words, you have to work for your audience.</p>
    <p>No podcaster is given an audience.</p>
    <p>You have to earn it.</p>
    <p>But before you can do that, you have to first go out there and:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Step #1 - Find out where your audience lives online and in the
        marketplace
      </li>
      <li>Step #2 - Connect with your audience and earn their trust</li>
      <li>
        Step #3 - Then convince them to become listeners with compelling content
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, that requires work.</p>
    <p>Lots and lots of work.</p>
    <p>
      So roll up your sleeves and get ready to do what it takes to earn an
      audience!
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step #1 - Find</strong></p>
    <p>
      First, you need to find your audience. Ask yourself this question:
      <em>Where does your audience live?</em> It's your topic, your passion, and
      the core to your podcast. As a result of being a subject matter expert,
      you probably know where your audience goes for information, conversation,
      and debate. A simple way to consider this is to think about is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What does your audience read?</li>
      <li>Where does your audience shop?</li>
      <li>What does your audience buy?</li>
      <li>Where does your audience share their thoughts?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is what it means to find out where your audience lives. Many of your
      audience members live online. Social media like Facebook, Twitter, and
      Instagram are great places to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, not everyone is producing a podcast that has a big online
      audience. In that case, ask yourself:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What does your audience read?</li>
      <li>What events do your audience attend?</li>
      <li>Where does your audience hang out?</li>
      <li>Where does your audience work?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finding your audience in the real world is just as relevant as finding
      them on the Internet. Once you find your audience or a location where your
      potential audience congregates it's time to watch them. Like a nature
      photographer or even a big game hunter, you need to watch your target
      audience with great enthusiasm. You're looking for them to tell you
      something about their position on your topic. These observations should
      include an understanding about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What do they complain about?</li>
      <li>What are their pains?</li>
      <li>What are their likes?</li>
      <li>What are their loves?</li>
      <li>What is controversial?</li>
      <li>What is the topic everyone is talking about?</li>
      <li>What is the topic no one is talking about?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Observer our audience with the same passion as you would present your
      topic. What you learn will greatly influence what comes next.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step #2 – Connect</strong></p>
    <p>
      Knowing what your audience is doing will become very valuable to your show
      preparations. Ideally, you want to now inject yourself into the
      conversation Not to pimp your podcast. Jumping in only to promote yourself
      will only alienate you and poison the well to your podcast engagement
      efforts. Instead, you need to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Give</li>
      <li>Give</li>
      <li>Give</li>
      <li>Give</li>
      <li>Give</li>
      <li>Then promote yourself</li>
      <li>Then give some more</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No, you don't see a mistake there. It does say <em>“Give”</em> five times.
      This the formula to engaging with your audience online or even in real
      life. Before you can sell anyone on your podcast, you need to give back
      first. You need to start being a member of the community and begin showing
      folks that you really do care about this subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with answering questions. Plenty of places — especially groups on
      Facebook — have new members that need beginner help. Start with reaching
      out to those getting into your topic and telling them the answer (from
      your point of view), or where they can find the answer Think about your
      topic and start asking questions yourself. Ask about the controversial,
      ignored, or hot topics to see what kind of conversation you can get
      started. But always do it from a place of service. Give your knowledge,
      your best tips, your time-tested advice, and your lessons learned freely.
      Follow in the footsteps of others that give away their own knowledge with
      a catch. You're not there to sell them, you're there to give to them. Then
      do it over and over and over again. Become the “go to” subject matter
      expert or someone people think of when they do get stuck or confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel with building your reputation with your target audience, you
      should be collecting each of those conversations with a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      That purpose is to reuse that content in your show. If you have a hotly
      contested conversation within your audience group online, carry that over
      into an episode. Don't replay the conversation word for word, but use it
      as a jumping off point for your podcast. Build episodes around those
      discussions where you take what you offered as advice and restate it in a
      podcast. Take your point of view and present a solution to any given
      problem. Use the issues and problems you encounter within your audience as
      the foundation for both micro and macro solutions that you talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several micro conversations might form one consolidated episode, while one
      macro conversation might become a theme for several episodes in a series.
      There also could be topics that don't have solutions or have two equally
      good solutions. This is the Apple versus PC or Coke versus Pepsi
      arguments. In this case, you're either going to need to take a side (and
      stick to it) or bring guests onto your show to argue the other side. This
      is what it is to Connect your audience. By observing them in the wild, you
      already know what everyone is talking about.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step #3 - Convince</strong></p>
    <p>
      Connecting with your audience now gives you a huge advantage. You now have
      a content generation machine just full of good ideas for future episodes.
      This will make your podcast relevant, it will give your content value that
      his compelling to your target audience.
      <em>Does it always have to be what your audience is interested in?</em> Of
      course not! It's your show. You can present or ignore any subject you feel
      like presenting or ignoring. It gives you the option to focus on topics
      that everyone in your group is talking about, or to bring up topics that
      your audience may not have considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives you power over the conversation. It also makes you look very
      involved with your topic. However, if you remember the advantage you have
      over others by finding out what your audience is NOT talking about? You
      now have the power to bring those topics up as you see fit too. Having
      knowledge of what everyone is and is not talking about provides you with a
      very big picture view of your topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when the time comes for you to change the subject, you now
      have all the topics and issues ready to go before anyone else.This is the
      core to the Convince step in the process: <em>Leadership!</em> Once you
      have a strong relationship with your audience groups, you now have the
      capability to start leading the conversation. This process starts with
      deciding what you think everyone should be talking about. Looking at all
      that has been said by your audience, the trends in your topic, and what
      podcast episodes you have already created, pick a topic that you feel
      strongly about. This could something that was already discussed, but
      chances are there is something you have been wanting to talk more about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when you're ready, the next time you connect with your audience,
      present this topic as a new conversation. Only in this new discussion,
      relate it back to the podcast episode on the same topic. This makes your
      podcast a continuation of what you're talking about, not the sole reason
      for talking about it. You already give away your best tips. Only now you
      can start to safely promote specific podcast episodes that relate back to
      the discussion you are starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extending the conversation this way should always be in connection with
      something relevant. Don't push people to an episode that does not extend
      the conversation. What you will find with this step is that it start to
      lead people interested in learning more right to your podcast without
      looking like you are leading them to it. It is simply an extension of a
      discussion that can only come AFTER you have gained your audience's trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have presented the content in a helpful way, then some of those
      visitors to your podcast will become subscribers. Finding out where they
      live and becoming a trusted source is essential to producing subscribers
      that become fans of your podcast. Listeners don't subscribe on accident.
      But sometimes they need a reason to choose you over all the other podcasts
      out there. Give them a compelling reason by earning their trust first. The
      rest will follow.
