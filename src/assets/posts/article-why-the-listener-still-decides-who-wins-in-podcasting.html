      Podcasting looks competitive on the surface. Podcast news is full of
      stories about Top 10 charts, download measuring contests, and millions in
      ad revenue up for grabs. But are we all competing for the same finite
      piece of the pie?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure, we all have the same gear, similar processes, and are the same
      players. However, our topics, audiences, and perspectives vary greatly.
      They‚Äôre like fingerprints. Most people have fingers but what is on those
      fingers, the random groves, is unique. Similar to how most podcasters have
      microphones, mixers, and recorders but no two shows are exactly alike.
      Turns out, adding that ‚Äúhuman element‚Äù makes a podcast special. It turns a
      formula into a one-of-a-kind experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Podcasters are also not stealing audiences from other shows. The listener
      decides which shows to listen to, not the podcaster. If you ask ten
      listeners, ‚ÄúWhy do you like this show over that show?‚Äù, you will get ten
      different answers. They can‚Äôt quantify why they like a certain show, they
      just do. In most cases, when listeners tell surveyors why they like a
      certain podcast, they respond simply, ‚ÄúI just like the way that podcaster
      tells a story.‚Äù This makes a podcast a personal choice for that listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only competition a podcaster needs to be focused on is time. There are
      only so many hours in the day that a person can use to listen to your
      podcast. This makes podcast selection important. If a listener decides to
      listen to your show then you are talking about a topic specific to their
      interests with a perspective and quality they enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the secret formula.</p>
    <p>Am I speaking better than the next podcaster? Maybe.</p>
    <p>Do I have better sound quality and music? Possibly.</p>
    <p>Am I talking about the same topics in the same way? Not a chance.</p>
    <p>
      This is where podcasters need to stop seeing each other as competition.
      Unless we both talk about the same topic that is inside a niche of a niche
      in a niche, our audience is not the same. And even if we do talk about the
      same specific topic, I will certainly talk about it differently than you
      do. If we go back to asking those ten listeners which podcaster does it
      better, you‚Äôre probably going to get ten different answers again. My
      audience likes the way I do it, while your audience likes the way you do
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here‚Äôs the rub ‚Äì they may like the way we both do it and listen to both
      podcasts!
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>
      Because it is not about the better podcast, it is about the specific
      podcaster. Listeners come for the topics but stay for the podcaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you discover that you cannot control what listeners like (or don‚Äôt
      like) then you are free:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Free to help other podcasters succeed.</li>
      <li>Free to give out your secrets.</li>
      <li>Even free to be nice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I believe this is the big revelation you need to embrace.</p>
    <p>
      Now, if you accept my premise that the listener has all the control then
      it stands to reason that we, as podcasters, have no control. This is not
      true. We have all the control we need over the production of our show, the
      quality of our research, the telling of our stories, and the amount of
      time we decide to spend showing up. We control all of these factors. The
      only thing we do not control is our audience. They get to choose to listen
      to us or not. All we can do is provide them with the best possible
      experience if or when they do decide to listen to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you do have complete control over how you treat other podcasters. When
      competition for audience is taken off the table it leaves room for
      collaboration, support, and just being downright nice to one another!
      Every other form of media is cutthroat.
    </p>
    <p>Every other form besides podcasting.</p>
    <p>
      Podcasters are the last vestige of unabridged free speech. If we don‚Äôt
      work together then how can we expect to keep it free?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can‚Äôt work with other podcasters and don‚Äôt want to help those who
      you see as competition, then at least, for starters, stop throwing
      punches.
    </p>
    <p>I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs asking too much.</p>
    <p>
      Maybe that little change will start you down the path of being nice to
      your fellow podcaster. Especially when you realize that in the
      non-zero-sum game of podcasting, the listener decides who wins.
