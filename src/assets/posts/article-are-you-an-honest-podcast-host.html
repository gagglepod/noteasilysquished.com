    <p>Do not attempt to manipulate your listener.</p>
    <p>
      The podcasting industry is full of bait-and-switch shows that claim to be
      about specific topics or viewpoints. Only when you listen to them do you
      discover they are 45-minute infomercials in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other shows lure you in with fancy teasers and trailers supporting an
      ideology or position then sucker punch you halfway through with
      ideological rants that push the opposite narrative, or worse, dress up
      slanted opinions disguised as factual news.
    </p>
    <p>
      In extreme cases, podcasters who have lied about serious subjects have
      been sued or even jailed.

    <p>Looking at you, True Crime investigative journalists!</p>
    <p>
      There are real legal dangers if you use your podcast to make false
      statements about somebody that might harm their reputation, place people
      in harm, either emotionally or physically, or threaten to assault or
      harass someone. While you might think you have the right to say these
      things you are not free from the consequences of what you say on your
      podcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever false thing you use your podcast to promote, eventually, someone
      will find out what you did. That's because the Internet writes in ink!
    </p>
    <p>
      As a principle, you should never pretend to be something you‚Äôre not or lie
      about other people on your show. Your podcast needs to be open,
      transparent, and above all, honest about your intentions!
    </p>
    <p>
      Be yourself without trying to be something you‚Äôre not and always use your
      podcast to tell the truth.
    </p>
    <p>Or, at the very least, don‚Äôt lie.</p>
