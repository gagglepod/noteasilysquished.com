    <title>How to transform your book into a podcast</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Did you write a book? Or create 52 episodes of a weekly podcast?</p>
    <p>
      Writing a book is hard. Selling a book is even harder. They don't call it
      the <em>Best Writing Author</em> â€” they call it the
      <em>Best Selling Author</em>! Ouch, right? Now, you sit on the long tail
      of Amazon's platform waiting for a nibble or two. All that work you put
      into writing a book only to have sales flatline.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's time to give that book a second life! How do you give it a second
      life? What if you could tell your story and sell your book at the same
      time? What if you could use all the content in your book to help drive
      sales to your book? You can with a podcast based on your book!
    </p>
    <p>
      The strategy is simple to understand, but difficult to execute. Here's a
      quick breakdown:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>#1 â€” Podcast Design:</strong> First, you will need to design a
      podcast based on your book's main premise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>#2 â€” Podcast Schedule:</strong> Next, you'll need to break your
      book up into 52 logical mini-topics, or topics that can be self-contained
      within a 20-60 minute audio episode. This can be segmented with your first
      episode that introduces your podcast, special episodes, and even
      interviews based on relevance to your topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, you really only need to come up with 40+ episodes actually
      based on your book's content. That should not be too difficult if you
      think about how your book is already organized. There's no need to
      recreate the wheel. Just follow your book's natural progression from
      episode to episode. Tell your story in spoken word audio the same way a
      reader would experience it themselves. If you think about your podcast as
      a reader would your book, 40+ episodes are really the 10-12 chapters of
      your book broken down into stand alone themes. Then within each of those
      chapter themes are possibly 3 or more sub-themes. Enough content for at
      least one year's worth of weekly podcasting (or more).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>#3 â€” Podcast Book Promotion:</strong> Finally, turn your stagnant
      book sales into a 52 episode audio series where each episode features your
      book as the content and the sponsor. The ads become your ads. The deals
      and sales become your deals and sales. When you control the content and
      the ads, everything comes to you. Not only can you expose listeners to
      each of your books main points, but you can engage with them, hear from
      them, and find out what they think of you and your concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives you tremendous leverage over other books on your topic. Other
      peoples books are just books. Your podcast on your book can become BONUS
      content for your book by including amplifying thoughts, additional
      viewpoints, and new information. Think of it as the
      <em>Directors Cut</em> of your book, only given out in 52 bite-sized
      chunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This strategy has a huge side benefit too. It helps you flesh out ideas
      for Book Number Two while you engage with real fans using content from
      Book Number One. This is A/B testing of a book you haven't even written
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, it can lead you to entirely different directions with content
      already tested to be what your audience wants. When you know what your
      audience wants, your can turn <em>Best Selling Author</em> into
      <em>Top Ranked Influencer</em> on your topic. It takes converting your
      book into a podcast to realize these advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, podcasting your book is not for those that only want to
      <em>try it out</em>. This is a strategy that requires you to become
      dedicated to podcasting for at least 1-year. In other words, you have to
      commit if this strategy is going to have any chance of working!
    </p>
    <p>
      Are YOU are ready to do the work that will save your book sales? If so,
      you have a huge advantage over most new podcasters. You not only have a
      year's worth of content to work with up front, but you also have a book to
      sell with your podcast. This gives authors something most podcasters wish
      they had: a head start!
