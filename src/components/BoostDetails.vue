          <p class="about-detail__info">
            Boosting is how you show an artist how you value them. It is also a way for
            the artist to benefit from their work while hearing directly from you!
          </p>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            However, before you can Boost you need to know <em>how</em> to Boost. The
            following directions should help make you dangerous.
            <strong>Happy Boosting!</strong>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            Third, you need a wallet. A wallet is where you
            turn your hard earn dollars into factions of a Bitcoin Called Satoshis -- or
            SATs! Once you have a SATs, a modern podcast app will give you the capability to Boost any podcast that is set up to receive them.</p>
            <p class="about-detail__info">
            Understanding wallets can be tricky. Fortunately, many modern podcast apps like <a href="https://truefans.fm" target="_blank">Truefans</a> or <a href="https://podcastguru.io" target="_blank">Podcast Guru</a> can help you get a wallet within their apps.
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            However, if you want to own your own wallet you can use external wallet apps like <a href="https://getalby.com/" target="_blank">Get Alby</a>, <a href="https://breez.technology/" target="_blank">Breez</a>, or <a href="https://podcasterwallet.com/" target="_blank">Podcaster Wallet</a>. 
            <p class="about-detail__info">
            The goal is to get a wallet that will allow you to hold SATs. Once you have your own wallet, you can connect it to any modern podcast app. </p>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            Fourth, once you got a few SATS in your wallet and that wallet is connected to your new, modern podcast app, it's time to Boost!</p>
            <p class="about-detail__info">When you play Flowgnar on your modern podcast app you will see the option to boost the podcast or the artist while it is playing. If you like what you hear, Boost them some SATs, which is to say you use that app
            to send them some of your SATs. That's it!</p>
            <p class="about-detail__info">But wait, there's more! A boost can include a short messaage that goes directly to the artist or the podcaster too. And I mean directly! They see it. They read it. And they <em>LOVE IT!</em> That's why it's called a <em>BOOST!</em>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            Finally, when you start getting the hang of boosting, you will start boosting all the time -- you won't be able to stop! Just make sure when you boost a song you tell them you heard it here on Flowgnar! </p>
            <p class="about-detail__info">
            Boosting opens up a whole new world of communication, apperciation, and monitization between you, the listener, and the hosts and artist you hear on Flowgnar! If you like what you hear and want to hear more, don't forget that you can even boost me when I'm jabbering away between tracks!</p>

            The best part of the Value 4 Value lifestyle is that any time you feel like you got value, you can give value back. Simple!

            The main goal of Flowgnar is to support the artists you hear on each episode. To quote the Podfather himself, Adam

            <em>Flowgnar is a <a href="https://oncetold.us/" target="_blank">Oncetold Music Experiment</a> created to support <a href="https://value4value.info/" target="_blank">Valueverse</a> music
            and was produced with the understanding that all songs are the property of
            their respective artists. Flowgnar passes on 90 percent of all Boosts to the
            artist while the song is playing.  I do get 10 percent from each boost to cover my part in putting Flowgnar together but a majority will always go to the artists.</em>
