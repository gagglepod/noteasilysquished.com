          <p class="feature__info">
            Oncetold allows you to design your podcast episode details BEFORE you ever
            record any audio. This can allow you to brainstorm ideas, plan your episodes,
            or have a member of your team create them for you. The best part is you can
            always change it later!

            We want you to be a podcaster, not an engineer. We designed Oncetold with a
            <em>less is more</em> mentality to provide an opinionated approach to podcast
            design. We removed all the confusing podcasting jargon, engineering
            jibber-jabber, and RSS-heavy tech talk. In its place, we created simple steps,
            streamlined tasks, and a culture of education.
