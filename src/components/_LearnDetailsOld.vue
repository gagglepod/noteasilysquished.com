            <a href="https://oncetold.us" target="_blank">Oncetold</a> is a Podcast
            Education and Technology Company that happens to do media hosting. Oncetold is
            also the answer to the mess and confusion that exists in today's podcast
            hosting arena. Nothing is more frustrating than software designed by
            engineers. When I approached the podcast hosting challenge, my goal was to
            think like a new podcaster and not an engineer. This mindset helped create a
            customer-first toolset that breaks everything down into bite-sized tasks.

            However, if you don't know how to podcast, or worse, don't know where to
            start, podcasting hosting is useless to you. That's why we created the
            Oncetold <em>Once Upon a Time</em> Podcasting Workshop. These lessons and
            courses will show you where to start, how to start, and how to build a podcast
            that works. You can't tell a story if you don't know how to podcast. Our
            <em>Once Upon a Time</em> Podcasting Workshop will get you there!

            Podcast Design is an act of communication. However, a common mistake made by
            most podcasters is thinking of ourselves as only audio communicators. We’re
            fortunate to speak the audio language fluently, but we need to be able to
            translate that thinking into visual and production skills as well. In other
            words, we need to be designers too. In this talk, Kyle Bondo will take you
            into the world of podcast design. Learn how to create, plan, and build your
            podcast BEFORE you produce it! Find out why a podcast design improves your
            quality, your recording process, your capability to engage and delight
            listeners. Don't make your podcast up as they go -- learn to survive your

          <p class="learn-detail__info">
            Why do new podcasters fail? Because they don't understand where their content
            comes from. Once they run out of their top ideas around episode #13, they
            struggle to keep away from the bear that is "the messy middle". And once that
            bear pounces, their podcast is in trouble! How do you survive the messy
            middle? By finding a green field of new topics long before you start
            recording. In this talk Kyle will walk you through 7 principles to good
            content design that you can use to find good content, decide what content
            belongs in your show (and what does not), and how to organize your episodes to
            keep your show on target when your motivation has run away.

            What makes your podcast weird? In podcasting, weird can be the one thing that
            makes you cool. It’s what makes you stand out from all the other podcasters in
            your space and creates fans – fans who “get you” because they’re just a little
            weird too. Not sure what your weird is or how to be weird? During this talk, I
            will illustrate the things that make some of my favorite podcasts just weird
