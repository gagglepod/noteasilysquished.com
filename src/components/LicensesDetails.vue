            You can even Boost me too -- like right now when I'm jabbering away Between
            tracks! I would love to hear from you! But the goal is to support these
            artists Or to quote the Podfather himself, Adam Curry over at Boostagram Ball:
            I play the tracks while the artist get the SATS! I do get a little from each
            Boost but that's for putting this all together It's you that keeps the
            Valueverse in motion All you need is a modern podcast app to get started Find
