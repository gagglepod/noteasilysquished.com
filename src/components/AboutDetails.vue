          <p class="about-detail__info">
            Whoa! We hear it all the time. But Oncetold is not another podcast media
            hosting company. We were built from the ground-up using a decade of real-world
            podcasting experience, endless frustration from using apps bolted together by
            a tone-deaf industry, and the revolutionary thinking behind Podcasting 2.0
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The result was Oncetold -- a podcasting company for audio creators.
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            Oncetold is our answer to the mess and confusion that exists in today's
            podcast hosting arena. Nothing is more frustrating than software designed by
            engineers. When we approach the podcast hosting challenge, We always think
            about the user experience first and design a toolset that works for actual
            podcasters. We don't chase features or worry about the things only big media
            cares about. We are for the little guy or gal, the solo podcaster, the small
            studio, and the niche network. And we plan to stay that way for a long, long
            time.

            Welcome to Oncetold. We're a podcasting company proving that you don't have to
            be big to have a big impact.

            We're podcasters who had enough of software designed by software engineers and
            audiophiles. That's why Oncetold is a podcasting company that has doubled down
            on simple. As big believers in the power of keeping it simple we're betting
            that making podcasting easier for you will pay off. That's why we only give
            you what you need to connect your audience to your podcast and make big bets
            on simplicity, clarity, ease-of-use, and honesty. This goes for our products,
            our podcasts, our publications, our talks, and our company.

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            We've built sharing into our DNA. We've given hundreds of talks -- from
            <a href="https://podfestexpo.com/" target="_blank">Meetups to Podfest</a> --
            that are packed with the lessons we've learned from stepping up to the mic. We
            produced a <a href="#">popular podcast called PODWRECKED</a> that focused on
            better ways to create a podcast. By producing our own podcasts ABOUT
            podcasting we have learned how to eat our own dog food, experienced the
            struggles you will face as a podcaster, and have survived to tell the tale.

            We're also talking about the podcast industry in our podcast
            <a href="https://oncetold.us/" target="_blank">Oncetold</a> and giving you a
            behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to run a podcast media hosting

            Every tech savvy company should enjoy a hardy breakfast of JAMStack (on
            Toast). If you run in tech circles, you've surely heard of JAMStack
            (JavaScript, API, and Markup). The Jamstack ecosystem at Oncetold has made us
            faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It's also a big part of the
            Podcasting 2.0 ecosystem. Today, JAMStack is as vibrant as ever, and because
            it is built into the heart of Oncetold, we hope to give back to JAMStack with
            our own internal experiments.

            Investing in things that don't go out of style
          </h2>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The best business advice we ever got came from two great thinkers. The first
            was from Sir Jonathan Ive from Apple. He told us, "[I]deas ultimately can be
            so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed,
            so easily compromised, so easily just squished." He taught us that ideas can
            be very fragile and we must live in between the dopey ideas and believing in
            bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Oncetold is a special environment for
            nurturing and incubating ideas.
          </p>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The other great thinker was Mark Twain who said, "The secret to getting ahead
            is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex
            overwhelming tasks into manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one."
            He shows us that simplicity should be at the heart of everything we do. 10
            years from now people aren't going to say "I wish Oncetold was harder to use"
            or "I wish Oncetold was slower and less reliable" or "I wish it took longer to
            get an answer from someone at Oncetold", so we invest heavily in
            infrastructure, great design, and customer service. We don't chase fads and
            trends, we stay focused on the things that will always be important.

            Treating people right is fundamental to how we do business. We treat our

            always been the same: Have fun, do exceptional work, build the best product in
            the business, experiment, pay attention to the details, treat people right,
            tell the truth, have a positive impact on the world around us, give back, and
            keep learning.
