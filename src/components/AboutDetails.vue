            Whoa! We hear that all the time. But Oncetold is not another podcasthosting
            company. We were built from the ground-up using a decade of real-world
            podcasting experience, endless frustration from using apps bolted together by
            a tone-deaf industry, and with the revolutionary thinking behind Podcasting
            2.0 flowing through our culture.
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The result was <em>Oncetold</em> -- a podcasting company for storytellers. For
            those yarn weavers, big dreamers, and true believers who just want to tell a
            good story.
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            Oncetold is our answer to the mess and confusion that exists in today's
            podcast hosting arena. Nothing is more frustrating than software designed by
            engineers. When we approach the podcast hosting challenge, We always think
            about the user experience first and design a toolset that works for actual
            podcasters. We don't chase features or worry about the things only big media
            cares about. We are for the little guy or gal, the solo podcaster, the small
            studio, and the niche network. And we plan to stay that way for a long, long
            time.

            Welcome to Oncetold. We're a podcasting company proving that you don't have to
            be big to have a big impact.

            We're podcasters who had enough of software designed by engineers and
            marketers. That's why Oncetold is a podcasting company that has doubled down
            on simple. As big believers in the power of keeping it simple we're betting
            that making podcasting easier for you will pay off. That's why we only give
            you what you need and make big bets on simplicity, clarity, ease-of-use, and
            honesty. This goes for our products, our podcasts, our publications, our
            talks, and our company.

            Treating people right is fundamental to how we do business. We treat our

            Investing in things that don't go out of style
          </h2>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The best business advice we ever got came from two great thinkers. The first
            was from Sir Jonathan Ive from Apple. He said:
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            <em
              >"[I]deas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely
              formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just
              squished."</em
            >
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            He taught us that ideas can be very fragile and we must live in between the
            barely formed ideas and believing in bold, crazy, magnificent ones. Oncetold
            is a special environment for nurturing and incubating those ideas.
          </p>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            We belived in Sir Ive's statement that we started a podcast about podcast
            design called
            <a href="https://noteasilysquished.com/" target="_blank"
              >Not Easily Squished. Have a listen.</a
            >
          </p>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The other great thinker we love to quote is Mark Twain who said:
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            <em
              >"The secret to getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting
              started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into manageable tasks,
              and then starting on the first one."</em
            >
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            He shows us that simplicity should be at the heart of everything we do. Ten
            years from now people aren't going to say:
            <em>"I wish Oncetold was harder to use"</em> or
            <em>"I wish Oncetold was slower and less reliable"</em> or
            <em>"I wish it took longer to get an answer from someone at Oncetold"</em>, so
            we invest heavily in infrastructure, great design, and customer service. We
            don't chase fads and trends, we stay focused on the things that will always be
            important.
