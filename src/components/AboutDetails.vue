            A Podcast Teaching Company that happens to do Media Hosting
          </h2>

            Whoa! We hear it all the time. But Oncetold is not another podcast media
            hosting company. We were built from the ground-up using a decade of real-world
            podcasting experience, endless frustration from using apps bolted together by
            a tone-deaf industry, and the revolutionary thinking behind Podcasting 2.0
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The result was Oncetold -- a podcasting company for audio creators.
          </p>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            Oncetold is our answer to the mess and confusion that exists in today's
            podcast hosting arena. Nothing is more frustrating than software designed by
            engineers. When we approach the podcast hosting challenge, We always think
            about the user experience first and design a toolset that works for actual
            podcasters. We don't chase features or worry about the things only big media
            cares about. We are for the little guy or gal, the solo podcaster, the small
            studio, and the niche network. And we plan to stay that way for a long, long
            time.

            Welcome to Oncetold. We're a podcasting company proving that you don't have to

            We're podcasters who had enough of software designed by software engineers and
            audiophiles. That's why Oncetold is a podcasting company that has doubled down
            on simple. As big believers in the power of keeping it simple we're betting
            that making podcasting easier for you will pay off. That's why we only give
            you what you need to connect your audience to your podcast and make big bets
            on simplicity, clarity, ease-of-use, and honesty. This goes for our products,
            our podcasts, our publications, our talks, and our company.

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            We've built sharing into our DNA. We've given hundreds of talks -- from
            <a href="https://podfestexpo.com/" target="_blank">Meetups to Podfest</a> --
            that are packed with the lessons we've learned from stepping up to the mic. We
            produced a <a href="#">popular podcast called PODWRECKED</a> that focused on
            better ways to create a podcast. By producing our own podcasts ABOUT
            podcasting we have learned how to eat our own dog food, experienced the
            struggles you will face as a podcaster, and have survived to tell the tale.

            We're a tech savvy company that enjoys a hardy breakfast of Podcasting 2.0
            Feature Tags, some JAMStack (JavaScript, API, and Markup) on toast, and a big
            glass of Firebase to wash it down. The open-source ecosystem at Oncetold has
            made us faster, more secure, and easier to scale. Today, open-source is as
            vibrant as ever, and because it is built into the heart of Oncetold, we often
            give back when we can.

            Investing in things that don't go out of style
          </h2>
          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The best business advice we ever got came from two great thinkers. The first
            was from Sir Jonathan Ive from Apple. He told us,
            <em
              >"[I]deas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely
              formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just
              squished."</em
            >
            He taught us that ideas can be very fragile and we must live in between the
            dopey ideas and believing in bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Oncetold is a
            special environment for nurturing and incubating ideas.
          </p>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            We belived in Sir Ive's statement that we started a podcast about Podcast
            Design Principles called
            <a href="https://noteasilysquished.com/" target="_blank"
              >Not Easily Squished. Have a listen.</a
            >
          </p>

          <p class="about-detail__info">
            The other great thinker was Mark Twain who said,
            <em
              >"The secret to getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting
              started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into manageable tasks,
              and then starting on the first one."</em
            >
            He shows us that simplicity should be at the heart of everything we do. 10
            years from now people aren't going to say,
            <em>"I wish Oncetold was harder to use"</em> or
            <em>"I wish Oncetold was slower and less reliable"</em> or
            <em>"I wish it took longer to get an answer from someone at Oncetold"</em>, so
            we invest heavily in infrastructure, great design, and customer service. We
            don't chase fads and trends, we stay focused on the things that will always be
            important.
