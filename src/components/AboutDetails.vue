            company. We were built from the ground up using a decade of real-world
            podcasting experience, endless frustration from using apps bolted together by
            a tone-deaf industry, and the revolutionary thinking behind Podcasting 2.0
            flowing through our culture.

            The result was <em>Oncetold</em> -- a podcasting company for storytellers. For
            those yarn weavers, big dreamers, and true believers who just want to tell a
            good story.

            He taught us that ideas can be very fragile and we must live in between the
            barely formed ideas and believing in bold, crazy, magnificent ones. Oncetold
            is a special environment for nurturing and incubating those ideas.
