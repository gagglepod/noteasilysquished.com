          <h2 class="lesson-detail__intro-heading">Why are you doing this</h2>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Internal Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The first step in the planning process requires you to define the reason (or
            reasons) you want to create a podcast in the first place.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">This is your <em>purpose</em>.</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Your purpose is internal to you and you alone. It should also be a good enough
            reason to keep your podcast going for longer then a few months.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            However, communicating your purpose can be difficult. Many of us have a hard
            time knowing why we want to do a podcast or why it is important to us.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            In the next section, I will give you three (3) good examples of what you
            purpose could be. If one of them feels right to you, use it!
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Defining Your Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The purpose of your podcast should be to <em>make meaning</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This is a principle that Guy Kawasaki, one of the co-founders of Apple
            Computers, presented at Stanford University in 2004. When he was asked what it
            meant to make something that mattered -- to give it meaning, Kawasaki told
            them it meant one of three things:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              To increase the quality of life of yourself or others
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">To right a wrong</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              To prevent the end of something good
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            These same concepts can apply to how you give meaning to your own podcast. I
            like to think of it as the <em>Purpose Principle</em>.
          </p>

          <picture class="lesson-detail__intro-image">
            <img

            />

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Improve a Life</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Are you doing this podcast to increase the quality of life of yourself and
            others? There’s a good chance that you are. You may have a deep drive to
            provide your listeners with information that could change their lives the same
            way it changed yours.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            You could also want to entertain people. Maybe you want to bring another
            person joy or laughter. Many motivational, personal growth, fitness, and
            coaching shows see life change as the primary purpose of their podcasts.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I believe changing a life is an excellent purpose behind your reasons for
            becoming a podcaster.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Right a Wrong</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            If you’re not driven by changing someone’s life, maybe your purpose is to
            right a wrong. Podcasting has created thousands of true crime investigative
            journalists and amateur detectives whose whole purpose is to solve a real
            mystery.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Righting a wrong could be your reason for trying to change the way people
            think about an overlooked or underappreciated point of view.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Many social, religious, cultural, political, and personal podcasts have this
            as their purpose. They use their shows to take on a cause worth fighting for.
            There are plenty of wrongs that need a spotlight. You could certainly do a lot
            of good with having this as your purpose.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Keep Good Alive</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The last way to make meaning according to Guy Kawasaki, is to prevent the end
            of something good. Many podcasters are very passionate about their topics and
            go into podcasting to connect with others who care as much as they do. Your
            purpose can be to become the conduit that keeps a good idea alive long after
            others have given up on it.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This could include long-forgotten lessons learned from history, pop culture,
            health, education, technology, sports, art, or even business. There are
            millions of good things that have been forgotten by the world. You could make
            it your purpose to remind people of that good and why it matters that we
            remember it or reconsider the lessons it taught us. Keeping something good
            alive is an excellent purpose and possibly a lifelong endeavor.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Time to Decide</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Because your purpose should be about making meaning with your podcast you may
            need to take some time and consider your reasons.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The benefit of doing this now is that it can serve you in becoming a driving
            factor that helps you keep podcasting when it gets hard.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">So, what is it? What is your purpose?</p>

              <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
                We're going to create a new podcast called <em>The AnonyMoose Files</em>.
                This section will help demonstrate how these principles are applied and
                how you following along as you design your own podcast.

            </div>
          </div>
          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">It Starts With a Reason</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The AnonyMoose Files was an idea I started with when I had a mountain biking
            accident out in the desert of Moab, Utah. I had passed out from dehydration
            and flipped over the handlebars and woke up hours later, cooking in 100-degree
            heat.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Luckily, I had two things with me that helped saved my life. I had my
            smartphone that was just within range of a cell tower to call for help, and a
            space blanket that allowed the Search & Rescue helicopter to find me in the
            middle of the Utah desert before the sun set.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">What a bad day but with a happy ending!</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            However, it got me thinking about wilderness survival. How many other people
            have stories like this? And if I had heard a story like this would I have
            planned my mountain biking trip better?
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">I think I would have.</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Saving a Life</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This has me leaning towards a purpose that includes increase the quality of
            life for others. I want to find stories of wilderness survival to both terrify
            and encouage my audience. The hope is that it will scare people into being
            prepared.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The reality is that I want a story I share to save the life of someone in my
            audience. I want at least one listener to say, "Because I listened to that
            podcast, I lived!"
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This sounds like a perfect purpose for my podcast: Tell wilderness survival
            stories to educate my audience.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This increases the quality of life of my audience because it could save their
            life.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I will remember this for the next lesson.
