          <h2 class="lesson-detail__intro-heading">What is Episode Planning?</h2>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            <strong>Episode Planning</strong> is all about taking your podcast's defined
            purpose and aligning it with your target audience to create episodes they will
            enjoy.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Walking the Path</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Episode Planning includes eight (8) incremental steps:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Purpose - Define your perspective</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Direction - Know who this is for</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Filtering - Find good sources</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Observation - Lurk with a purpose</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Bucketing - Sort and find patterns</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Selection - Choose the best 12 themes
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Prioritization - Pick the best-themed stories
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Scheduling - Establish an order</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Internal Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The first step in the planning process requires you to define your
            perspective. Your perspective, or your point of view on the podcast topic
            you're interested in, is essential in knowing who your audience is going to
            be. They will like what you like.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">External Direction</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Once you know your purpose, you can define your direction. Direction is the
            clear understanding of who this podcast is for. While your perspective is
            internal to you, your direction is external. It is the reason you give your
            audience why they should listen.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The goal of this step is to define your <em>WHY statement</em>, a single
            sentence that establishes the reason your podcast exists.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding Good Sources</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Next, with your WHY statement at the ready, you can use it as a clear
            constraint for finding sources that serve your audience. By applying this
            filter to your search for credible and reusable sources you can narrow your
            focus and discard anything that does not match your direction.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Lurking with a Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            With each source you find, you are taking notes on what your potential
            audience both wants and needs. These could be anything from a few words to a
            few sentences, just enough to get the main idea and where you got it from. It
            should be just enough to inspire a story.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            However, not all sources are equal. Each of your sources -- websites, blogs,
            articles, forums, social media posts, scholarly, papers, books, newspapers,
            other podcast, experts, witnesses, etc -- will need to be inspected, judged,
            and ranked.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This will provide you with a short list of sources that can provide you with
            renewable value. These sources become your deep well of information.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding Patterns</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            After collecting numerous notes from sources that you can trust, you will be
            left with an unorganized collection of insights and story ideas that you will
            have to sort into buckets.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Each of these buckets -- or story buckets -- is simply an organized collection
            of your notes that all center around a central theme. What these themes are
            called is an exercise in guided judgment. Because you are the creative mind
            behind this effort, you will get to decide which theme applies to which
            logical story bucket.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The story buckets step takes the longest. Mainly because there is no right or
            wrong answer to how you decide on organizing them into themes. Sometimes, a
            certain theme clearly belongs to one story bucket, only to discover that that
            theme is actually two similar but separate themes.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            These themes don't appear right away. They take time to materialize. However,
            over time you will start to see better theme groupings for patterns you didn't
            notice before.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Choose the Best Themes</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            With all your research organized into themes, the next step is to decide which
            themes you want to tackle first. These are the themes that inspire you, can be
            developed into a series, or simply have the most topics.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Choose the Best Stories</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Having your top themes selected, you can now start to think of your story arc.
            This is how you establish a logical structure for which stories best represent
            the selected theme. The selection and priority of these stories will
            ultimately form how the overall narrative will flow within each theme.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Establish an Order</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The final step in the process is establishing the order you will tell these
            stories in. It is a list, divided by theme, of episode topics that you, and by
            extension your audience, will find the most compelling. It is also your
            roadmap to creating recording session schedules, detailed scripts, teasers,
            and what you should be working on next for all your episodes.
          </p>
          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Ready to Start Planning?</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            By the end of this course, you should have a solid understanding of podcast
            planning principles, a collection of reliable sources, a repeatable research
            strategy, and a scheduled list of episodes that connect with your purpose and
            your target audience.

            <strong>Every podcast</strong> needs to create -- at a minimum -- five (5)
            systems:

          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">A system for thinking up ideas</li>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Planning Season</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Episode Planning can be done anytime. However, it should be done before you
            every start your podcast. Do not start a podcast without first going through
            the episode planning process at least once.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Warning Notice</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            When you don't do episode planning before you start your podcast you risk
            driving down the road without a map. If you don't know where you're going, any
            road will take you there. Unfortunately, your audience is only down one
            specific road.
