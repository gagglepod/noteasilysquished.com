          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">
            Why, Oh, Why Have a Why Statement?
          </h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Your <em>Why Statement</em> is your podcast's mission statement.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            If your purpose is an intrinsic expression of why <em>YOU</em> are doing this,
            then your <em>Why Statement</em> is an extrinsic expression of why your
            <em>target audience</em> should listen to it.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It is a way of taking everything you've decided on, up with this point -- your
            idea (What will I talk about), your purpose (Why am I doing this), and your
            target audience (Who is this for) -- and distilling it down into a single,
            cripy sentence.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The best part of a Why Statement is a daily reminder of the promise you are
            making to your target audience. It is the service level agreement you make
            with your listener that tells them what they should expect to hear every
            episode when they press play.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The reason you do this it to declare -- to <em>YOURSELF</em> -- who this
            podcast is for and why that audience should listen to it.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Externally, you share your Why Statement as the description to your podcast.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            But internally, you need to look at it every day, every time you step up to
            the microphone, and most importantly, every time you plan an episode.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Building a Why Statement</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Every <em>Why Statement</em> begins by answering these five questions:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">What will I talk about - Idea/Topic</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Why am I doing this - Purpose/Direction (Lesson 3)
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Who is this for - Perspective/Bias/Target Audience (Lesson 4)
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Who will be the talent - Talent/Host/Voices
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">When will it be done - Goal/Ending</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            These are not trick questions. Instead, they are meant to be thought-provoking
            in a way that gets you to take your podcast's production seriously.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Let's take this question one at a time.</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">What will I talk about?</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Well? What are you going to talk about? What is your core idea or topic you
            will focus on?
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Why am I doing this?</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I walked you through <em>making meaning</em> in
            <a
              href="/learn/courses/episode-planning-masterclass/lesson-03"
              class="lesson-detail__link"
              >Lesson 03</a
            >
            that hopefully helped you decide on your purpose for this podcast.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            If you did not decided on your purpose, I recommend you go back to
            <a
              href="/learn/courses/episode-planning-masterclass/lesson-03"
              class="lesson-detail__link"
              >Lesson 03</a
            >
            and take another try at establishing one.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Who is this for?</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I walked you through picking a side and deciding on your
            <em>target audience</em> in
            <a
              href="/learn/courses/episode-planning-masterclass/lesson-04"
              class="lesson-detail__link"
              >Lesson 04</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            If your target audience is still a mystery to you, I recommend you go back to
            <a
              href="/learn/courses/episode-planning-masterclass/lesson-04"
              class="lesson-detail__link"
              >Lesson 04</a
            >
            and try to define that niche one more time.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Who will be the talent?</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This should be an easy question to answer. Either you are the host or your
            not. If you are not the host, who is?
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Or if you are going to be a co-host then who else will co-hosting with you?
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Solve for X.</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">When will it be done?</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This is a question defining your <em>definition of done</em>. It may seem easy
            but it can be a tricky one.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This is a question defining your <em>definition of done</em>. It may seem easy
            but it can be a tricky one. All podcasters want their podcast to last forever.
            Sadly, it will not. It may go on for many, many years but at some point, it
            will end.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            However, your definition of done does not need to be a date but rather a part
            of the statement that defines the totality of your work. This could mean
            <em>until I talk to everyone there is to talk to</em>,
            <em>until the case is solved</em>, or
            <em>until the I reach the end of the battle</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Or it could simply be <em>until I decide it's done</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The point of the question is force you to consider what done would mean to
            you.It's your podcast. You decide if there is an ending or goal.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">One Sentence, Please</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            All the work up to this point has been to establish a clear, concise, and
            crispy understanding of your podcast's details.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Now that you understand the principle behind the reason for a Why Statement,
            its time to create your own one-sentence Why Statement by simply filling in
            the blanks:
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            <em
              >The [PODCAST NAME] is a podcast hosted by [TALENT NAME] about [IDEA/TOPIC]
              for [TARGET AUDIENCE] that like to hear about [NICHE/BIAS/PERSPECTIVE] until
              [GOAL].</em
            >
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Is that it? Yes! That's it! But look how far you've come to get this one
            sentence in place.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Is a Why Statement set in stone? No! You can change any of the words, leave
            off the "until [GOAL]", change hosted to co-hosted -- it's your show!
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Once you've finished crafting your Why Statement to your own satifaction,
            remember it. Recite it everytime you sit down to record your podcast. Place it
            on a sticky-note on your wall and read it every day.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This is your podcast's map -- don't lose it!
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Now What?</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The point to all these lessons up to now was to have you
            <em>think through</em> your podcast design <em>BEFORE</em> you started
            planning episodes.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            In the next lessons, you will find that your answers to these important
            questions will make or break how you plan you episodes.

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Here is the Why Statement to The AnonyMoose Files:
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            <em
              >The [AnonyMoose Files] is a podcast hosted by [Kyle Bondo] about
              [Wilderness Survival Stories] for [Outdoor Survivalists] that like to hear
              how others [Escape Disaster].</em
            >
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Let’s take this apart and see why it works.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            First, I have identified my core idea with a topic focusing on Wilderness
            Survival Stories. It’s not about all Survival Stories.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It's not even about Desert, Jungle, or even Ocean survival either. I only want
            the stories where someone had to survive in <em>The Wilderness</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Now that is a niche!</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding Riches in the Niches</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Next, I have an established bias too. I only want those stories where someone
            <em>Escaped Disaster</em>. I want actual survivors!
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This is what picking a side looks like. Will it be for those interested in
            those who did not survive in the wilderness? Nope. I don’t care. And neither
            should you because that is not my audience.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Speaking of audience, I state clearly that this podcast will be for Outdoor
            Survivalists who enjoy immersive, interview and/or documentary-style,
            storytelling. This means the details are important to them.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            What do I do about those who want a podcast like Call of the Wild – a
            fictional story? Or those looking for a harder, academic vibe? I might not be
            for you either.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I’m telling a story about Wilderness Survival from the survivors point of view
            that I want to tell. It will be factual but it will also be immersive – as in
            it will be full of sound effects and atmospheric music. Some Outdoor
            Survivalists enjoy immersive, interview and/or documentary-style,
            storytelling.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Those are my listeners!</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Those that don't are not my listeners.</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">It doesn’t get more crispy than that!</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            My definition of done might not be clear and it often optional.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            You could have the same goal as <em>Coming Home with Bob Abbot</em>, a podcast
            about the ongoing problem of Veteran mental health and possible solutions. His
            podcast’s own tagline is <em>Until Everyone Comes Home</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This means Bob is not done until every US military service member comes back
            home to the United States of America. Considering how our world is in constant
            termoil overseas, that’s probably not going to happen any time soon. Which,
            for Bob, means his Why is literally <em>Until Everyone Comes Home</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            That is a super crispy why and a definition of done.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It gives Bob his target audience -- US military service members -- and when he
            will be done, which is potentially forever. Both are important elements in
            creating a strong Why Statement.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Remember your Why Statement for the next lesson.
