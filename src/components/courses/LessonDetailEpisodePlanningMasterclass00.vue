          <h2 class="lesson-detail__intro-heading">I want to tell you a story</h2>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">This is a story about Bob.</p>
          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Once upon a time...</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Bob started a podcast.</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Bob is very excited about podcasting. He watched a bunch of videos, reads
            everything on social media, and maybe even bought some books. Bob cannot wait
            to start talking. So, he immediately goes out and buys a microphone, plugs it
            in, and starts recording.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Yeah, Bob!</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Let's say Bob gets episode #1 out and feels great. He seems to be off to a
            great start but Bob has made a critical mistake. He hasn't planned any part of
            his podcast nor did he do any research. He is just winging it.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            And as he moves forward with episodes #2, #3, #5, all the way to #10.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Here Comes Trouble</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            As it gets harder for him to come up with ideas for his next episode, Bob
            starts to struggle. He's getting very few downloads, no emails, and zero
            feedback. He starts to ask himself,
            <em>"Do I really want to do this podcast thing?"</em>
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            And as it gets more and more difficult for Bob to keep his motivation going.
            Something is wrong, but Bob doesn't know how to fix it.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Then he hits episode #13.</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Welcome to The Messy Middle</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Where Bob's lack of feedback or downloads runs head-first into his waning
            motivation. And like a raging beast, The Messy Middle attacks when you are at
            your lowest point.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            With nothing solid to fall back on, Bob decides to push his podcast back a
            day. And then he misses a week. Then a month. And before you know it, Bob's
            podcast has <em>podfaded</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Before long it's been six months and the Messy Middle had grinded Bob's
            podcast down into a <em>podwreck</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            When Bob goes from a podfade to a podwreck, his podcast is effectively a
            goner. Like they say in <em>The Lion King, "Hakuna Matata" -- No worries</em>.
            It's the circle of life. Or should I say the circle of <em>podcast life</em>?
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">How did this happen?</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            There are 2,650,800 podcasts in Apple's podcast directory (January 2024), of
            which 455,900 are active podcasts. That leaves 2,194,900 podcasts that are NOT
            active. That's a lot of Bobs!
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            How did this happen to Bob? How did his podcast become a <em>podwreck</em>?
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Simple. Bob used the <em>Wing It Strategy</em>. This is the strategy where you
            say, "Nah, I don't need to plan. I'll just wing it!" And you do until the
            wing-it strategy stops working somewhere around episode #13.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Because Bob rushed into podcasting without a plan, he got stuck. And most of
            us get stuck when we discover just how hard podcasting really is.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Unfortunately, for most new podcasters, when podcasting starts to get hard --
            and the numbers back this up -- most of them quit!
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">But Not Today</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Today, with this course, you are going to fight back! You will learn how to
            build a plan that will launch far past episode #13.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Are you with me? If so, then continue on to learn what it takes to survive
            your podcast!

          <h2 class="lesson-detail__intro-heading">A New Story Each Episode</h2>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The AnonyMoose Files was an idea I started with when I had a mountain biking
            accident out in the desert of Moab, Utah. I had passed out from dehydration
            and flipped over the handlebars and woke up hours later, cooking in 100-degree
            heat.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Luckily, I had two things with me that helped saved my life. I had my
            smartphone that was just within range of a cell tower to call for help, and a
            space blanket that allowed the Search & Rescue helicopter to find me in the
            middle of the Utah desert before the sun set.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This got me thinking about wilderness survival. How many other people have
            stories like this? And if I had heard a story like this would I have planned
            my mountain biking trip better?
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">I think I would have.</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This has me leaning towards a purpose that includes increase the quality of
            life for others. I want to find stories of wilderness survival to both terrify
            and encouage my audience. The hope is that it will scare people into being
            prepared.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The reality is that I want a story I share to save the life of someone in my
            audience. I want at least one listener to say, "Because I listened to that
            podcast, I lived!"
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This sounds like a perfect purpose for my podcast: Tell wilderness survival
            stories to educate my audience.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This increases the quality of life of my audience because it could save their
            life.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I will remember this for the next lesson.
