          <h2 class="lesson-detail__intro-heading">Who This is For?</h2>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">External Direction</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Once you know your purpose, you can define your direction. Direction is the
            clear understanding of who this podcast is for.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            While your perspective is internal to you, your direction is external. It is
            the reason you give your audience why they should listen.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The goal of this step is to define your <em>WHY statement</em>, a single
            sentence that establishes the reason your podcast exists.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Understanding Perspective</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Your perspective is nothing more than your personal point of view. It is
            <em>how</em> you see, feel, and approach the world.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It's a fancy way of saying <em>bias</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            We all have them. It is fundemental to how we filter out the things we don't
            like for the things we do. It helps us quickly determine what we love, hate,
            want, or need.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            When we start designing a podcast, understanding our perspective -- our biases
            -- on our chosen topic is important because it will aid us in identifying our
            audience.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            These are the people that also identify with our perspective and enjoy the
            insights we create based on our point-of-view.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            In podcasting, we call this finding our <em>target audience</em>.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Why vs. Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            You might consider your why and your purpose to be interchangeable.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">I don't.</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I see your why – as in your why statement – a clear definition of what your
            podcast is about and who your podcast is for. It’s an extrinsic expression to
            remind you what your audience expects to hear when they press play.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Meanwhile, your purpose is an intrinsic expression of your why. If your why
            statement is for those outside of you – your listeners – then your purpose is
            for you alone – the reason you are doing this podcast in the first place.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Knowing Your Who</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Everyone teaching podcasting tries to tell you to start with your why, as in,
            <em>"Why are you doing this?"</em>. We just did that by defining your purpose.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Instead, you need to move on to your <em>Who</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Unfortunately, too many podcasters never stop to consider their why. Instead,
            they start podcasting by jumping straight into buying a microphone, purchasing
            media hosting, setting up an Apple Podcast account, and thinking about all the
            money they’re going to make.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            They never stop to understand why they are building a podcast in the first
            place or why it’s important to get your why correct.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Can I say why one more time?</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Thank you.</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            In all seriousness, I strongly believe that without defining your why, your
            podcast will drown your efforts. That’s why your why is the most important
            part of your podcast! It is your lighthouse.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It is your beacon back to safe harbors when you get lost and your liferaft
            when you’re close to podwrecking.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The good news is that you know why this is so important to get right! To begin
            creating your why, every new podcaster, and every podcaster starting a new
            podcast needs to begin by answering these five questions:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Why are you doing this?</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Why this topic?</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Why this audience?</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Why you?</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Why now?</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            These are not trick questions. Instead, they are meant to be thought-provoking
            in a way that gets you to consider your purpose, intentions, and motivations
            for starting this show.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The principle behind them is to get you thinking about the elements of your
            why statement – a one-sentence description of your podcast so crispy and clear
            that it removes all doubt about what your idea is, who your talent will be,
            what perspective you have, what direction it will go in and when you will be
            done.
          </p>
          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Focus on your Target Listener</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            For example, here is the why statement to my podcast War Yankee - Overland:
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            <em
              >War Yankee - Overland is a podcast hosted by Kyle Bondo about the Unionist
              view of the American Civil War during the Overland Campaign of 1864 for
              history buffs and students of history who enjoy immersive,
              documentary-style, storytelling.</em
            >
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Let’s take this apart and see why it works.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            First, I have identified my core idea with a topic focusing on the Unionist
            view of the American Civil War during the Overland Campaign of 1864. It’s not
            about all American wars, it’s not even about the entire Civil War.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Heck, it’s not even about both sides of the Civil War.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Now that is a niche!</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding Riches in the Niches</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Next, my perspective is clear. My selected bias is the Unionist view of the
            American Civil War. I’m going to talk only about the North – the Union Army
            and its leaders.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This is what picking a side looks like. Will it upset those interested in the
            South’s side of the story? I don’t care. And neither should you because that
            is not my audience.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Speaking of audience, I state clearly that this podcast will be for history
            buffs and students of history who enjoy immersive, documentary-style,
            storytelling.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            What do I do about those who want a podcast like Gone with the Wind – a
            fictional story? Or those looking for a harder, academic vibe? I might not be
            for you either.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I’m telling a story about the American Civil War that I want to tell. It will
            be factual but it will also be immersive – as in it will be full of sound
            effects and atmospheric music. Some history buffs and students of history
            enjoy immersive, documentary-style, storytelling.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Those are my listeners!</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Getting Crispy with Your Why</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Finally, my why statement comes with a crispy, built-in definition of done:
            The Overland Campaign of 1864. The military campaign I will be covering not
            only has a definite beginning and end but I state it outright – 1864. Not 1863
            or 1865 but 1864.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">It doesn’t get more crispy than that!</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Your definition of done might not be that clear. You could have the same goal
            as <em>Coming Home with Bob Abbot</em>, a podcast about the ongoing problem of
            Veteran mental health and possible solutions. His podcast’s own tagline is
            <em>Until Everyone Comes Home</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This means Bob is not done until every US military service member comes back
            home to the United States of America. Considering how our world is in constant
            termoil overseas, that’s probably not going to happen any time soon. Which,
            for Bob, means his Why is literally <em>Until Everyone Comes Home</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">That is a super crispy why.</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It gives Bob his target audience -- US military service members, and when he
            will be done -- potentially forever. Both are important elements in creating a
            strong Why Statement.
          </p>
          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">The Why Statement</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The Why Statement is a single sentence that you craft by answering those five,
            thought-provoking whys. The why questions are only an tool to help you dig
            deep into your idea and go beyond the purpose to your podcast.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            While your why statement is powerful, it doesn't start that way. It starts out
            as a fragile idea in your mind, a barely formed thought. Your job is to take
            that fragile idea and give it a form.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            However, once you complete your why statement, you will always know what your
            podcast is about and who it is for.
