          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Understanding Perspective</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Your perspective is your personal point of view and is defined as
            <em>how</em> you see, feel, and approach the world.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It's a fancy way of saying <em>bias</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            We all have them. It is fundemental to how we filter out the things we don't
            like for the things we do. It helps us quickly determine what we love, hate,
            want, or need.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            When we start designing a podcast, understanding our perspective or biases on
            our chosen topic is an important factor in identifying our audience.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            These are the people that also identify with our perspective and enjoy the
            insights we create based on our point-of-view.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            In podcasting, we call these people our <em>target audience</em>.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Knowing Your Who</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            While your purpose is internal to you, your perspective is external. It is the
            reason you give your audience why they should listen.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Unfortunately, too many podcasters never stop to consider their target
            audience. Instead, they start podcasting by jumping straight into buying a
            microphone, purchasing media hosting, setting up an Apple Podcast account, and
            thinking about all the money they’re going to make.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            They never stop to understand who they are building a podcast for in the first
            place or why it’s important to get your who correct.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I strongly believe that without defining your who, your podcast will drown in
            obscurity. In other words, a podcast that is for everyone is for no one.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            That’s why your knowing your target audience is an essential element to
            building a successful podcast. It is your compass out of the dark forest when
            you get lost and don't which way to go next.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Knowing your target audience gives you direction.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding your Target Audience</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            To illustrate how to find your target audience you need to
            <em>get crispy</em> with who you think is your ideal listener. This is to say
            that the more defined you can make this person the better you will be at
            creating episodes they will enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            First, my purpose and perspective have already helped me make some big
            decisions about my core topic and my point of view on my topic. This means I
            have already narrowed my focus for who this will be for, and who this will not
            be for.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Next, you refine my perspective so that it is crystal clear. To make this
            super crispy you make a decision and pick a side.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            To do this you simply have to declare this decision this way:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              This podcast will be for those who agree with my purpose and point of view.
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              This podcast will not be for those who disagree with my purpose and point of
              view.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">See? Simple.</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            You might be saying, "Didn't we just eliminate half of my potential audience
            this way?"
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Maybe. But they where not going to listen to you anyway. Why? Because they
            don't agree with your point of view. They are not worth chasing because they
            are not your target audience.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Only those who do agree with your point of view are your target audience.
            Focus on them and on what they might want from your podcast!
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Finally, you need to <em>niche down</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This is the process of taking all the people that agree with your purpose
            <em>AND</em> your point of view, and then filtering most of them out by
            focusing in on one, very narrow sub-set of your topic.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Here are some examples of niching down:</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Example #1: History</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Changing Your Niche</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Niching down can be very dauntling to first time podcasters. It's normal to
            want to be open to a larger number of people.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Don't do it.</p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Focusing on your narrow topic will create will help you attract more true fans
            <em>because</em> of how narrow your niche is, not despite it.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Additionally, a narrow focus puts your podcast in a space with less
            competition. When fewer podcasts are talking about your topic you have a
            better chance of being found.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Once you've established an audience, you will naturally discover ways to
            broaden out from your narrow topic or find taht your audience is full of
            suggestions.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            However, these are principles, not rules. Some topics don't have much
            competition while others don't have competition that is taking the other side.
            You have free reign to decide how broad or narrow you want to be.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            But remember that the more narrow -- the more crispy -- you are the easier it
            will be to find your target audience.

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding Our Niche</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            For The AnonyMoose Files podcast, we need to figure out who are target
            audience will be. Here is what I came up with:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Your Purpose: Stories about wilderness survival (Improving a Life)
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Your Topic: Talk to only survivors who almost died but somehow survived the
              wilderness.
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Target Audience: recreational mountain bikers, hikers, fishermen/hunters,
              campers, off-the-grid homesteaders
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Niche Target Audience: Outdoor Survivalists
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            How did I get there? Good question! To do this, we need to work through what
            we know about this podcast and then identify which people we think might agree
            with our purpose
            <em>AND</em> our point of view.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Then, filter most of them out by focusing in on one, very narrow sub-set of
            our topic.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Ready?</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Start With Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            We need to first remember the purpose we already decided on for The AnonyMoose
            Files way back in
            <a
              href="/learn/courses/episode-planning-masterclass/lesson-03"
              class="lesson-detail__link"
              >Lesson 03</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            To refresh your memory, we decided that this podcast will be about telling
            wilderness survival stories to educate our audience.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            We want this podcast to improve a listeners life by giving them tips on what
            to do (and not do) when in the great outdoors.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Refine our Topic</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Next, we need to pick a side, start a fight, or just get more specific about
            our topic.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            To do that we need to focus in on what kind of person wants to hear stories
            about surviving in the outdoors.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Does that include all outdoor and recreation lovers? Its a good place to start
            but its too broad. It could mean anybody who likes to go outside. This
            includes anyone from gardeners to park rangers.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I don't think we will find too many interesting stories about someone getting
            lost in their garden.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The AnonyMoose Files needs people who actually have problems in the outdoors.
            We need hardcore outdoor enthusiasts. These are the people who use the word
            <em>outings</em> and <em>expeditions</em>.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This could focus us to narrow our scope down to people who venture into the
            wilderness. Hardcore outdoor enthusiasts who do <em>wilderness</em> activities
            away from real help seems like a good target audience to aim for.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            If we are chosing to focus on Hardcore outdoor enthusiasts as our target
            audience, then it will force us to modify our topic to be more detailed about
            the survival stories we tell.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Being too general will not work for these people. They are going to want to
            know all the details about how someone survived the wilderness.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This might force us to move away from just stories and try interviewing these
            people instead. That presents an interesting design problem. Do we change the
            show to attract a certain audience? Or do we stay the course and modify our
            target audience expectations?
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Have to think about that one.</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Deciding Our Target Audience</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Okay. I thought about it. I think for now our podcast would work best if we
            told stories of wilderness survival. We might try interviews at a later date
            but for now we'll stick to good old fashioned storytelling.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            That means our target audience includes anyone in the hardcore outdoor
            enthusiast circle. Thhis could include anyone from recreational mountain
            bikers, hikers, and fishermen/hunters, to campers and off-the-grid
            homesteaders.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Basically anyone who could go missing in the wilderness could benefit from our
            show. But these type of outdoor enthusiasts are particularly vulnerable.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Niching Down</h3>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            We could, in all honesty, stop there. Most outdoor enthusiasts, hardcore or
            not, could enjoy and be informed by stories about surviving in the wilderness.
            This target audience is a good place as any to start from.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Howerver, I want to take this a step further.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">I want to <em>niche down</em>!</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            No worries. If niching down doesn't give us enough stories to work with, we
            can always go back up to the broader niche.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Again, these are principles, not rules.</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            To niche down into stories about surviving in the wilderness, I want to get
            very detailed. I want to show how you can get lost and live off the land.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This would not be just stories of people who looked death in the eye and lived
            to tell the tale! No, it would be those that walked into the wilderness with
            nothing on their back and built a life.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I want to only tell stories of long-term wilderness survival.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">Now, that's a niche!</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            I don't have to stay in that niche but it does give me an optional direction
            to go if I want. Until I hit record, I still have a lot of choices.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Remember all of this for the next lesson. You will need it!
          </p>
