          <h2 class="lesson-detail__intro-heading">What is Episode Planning?</h2>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            <strong>Episode Planning</strong> is all about taking your podcast's defined
            purpose and aligning it with your target audience to create episodes they will
            enjoy.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Episode Planning is a System</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Every podcast is made up of systems. At a minimum, most podcasts have five (5)
            systems:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">A system for thinking up ideas</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              <strong>A system for creating episodes</strong> (You Are Here!)
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">A system for editing audio</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">A system for publishing</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">A system for finding your audience</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Episode planning <em>IS</em> your system for creating episodes.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Planning Season</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            While episode planning can be done anytime, it should be done before you every
            start any podcast. Do not start a podcast without first going through the
            episode planning process at least once.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            However, once you start, you should revisit your plan after every episode to
            make sure you don't need to make any corrections.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Why Episode Planning Matters</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there. This is
            why when you don't do episode planning before you start your podcast you risk
            driving down the road without a map.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            When your audience is down one specific and tiny road you need to make sure
            your directions are correct. Bad directions means getting lost.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info"><em>No map equals no audience!</em></p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Walking the Path</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Episode Planning includes eight (8) incremental steps:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Purpose - Define your perspective</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Direction - Know who this is for</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Filtering - Find good sources</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Observation - Lurk with a purpose</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Bucketing - Sort and find patterns</li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Selection - Choosing the best themes
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">
              Prioritization - Picking the stories
            </li>
            <li class="lesson-detail__intro-list">Scheduling - Establish an order</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Internal Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The first step in the planning process requires you to define your
            perspective.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Your perspective, or your point of view on the podcast topic you're interested
            in, is essential in knowing who your audience is going to be. They will like
            what you like.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">External Direction</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Once you know your purpose, you can define your direction. Direction is the
            clear understanding of who this podcast is for.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            While your perspective is internal to you, your direction is external. It is
            the reason you give your audience why they should listen.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The goal of this step is to define your <em>WHY statement</em>, a single
            sentence that establishes the reason your podcast exists.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding Good Sources</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Next, with your WHY statement at the ready, you can use it as a clear
            constraint for finding sources that serve your audience.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            By applying this filter to your search for credible and reusable sources you
            can narrow your focus and discard anything that does not match your direction.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Lurking with a Purpose</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            With each source you find, you are taking notes on what your potential
            audience both wants and needs. These could be anything from a few words to a
            few sentences, just enough to get the main idea and where you got it from. It
            should be just enough to inspire a story.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">However, not all sources are equal.</p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Each of your sources -- websites, blogs, articles, forums, social media posts,
            scholarly, papers, books, newspapers, other podcast, experts, witnesses, etc
            -- will need to be inspected, judged, and ranked.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This will provide you with a short list of sources that can provide you with
            renewable value. These sources become your deep well of information.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Finding Patterns</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            After collecting numerous notes from sources that you can trust, you will be
            left with an unorganized collection of insights and story ideas that you will
            have to sort into buckets.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Each of these buckets -- or story buckets -- is simply an organized collection
            of your notes that all center around a central theme.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            What these themes are called is an exercise in guided judgment. Because you
            are the creative mind behind this effort, you will get to decide which theme
            applies to which logical story bucket.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The story buckets step takes the longest. Mainly because there is no right or
            wrong answer to how you decide on organizing them into themes.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">
            Finding Patterns within Patterns
          </h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Sometimes, a certain theme clearly belongs to one story bucket, only to
            discover that that theme is actually two similar but separate themes.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            This is where you discover the topics no one else is talking about!
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            While it takes time for these themes to materialize, over time you will start
            to see better theme groupings appear inside each of your buckets you didn't
            notice before.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">You will cannot help but notice them!</p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Choose the Best Themes</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            With all your research organized into themes, the next step is to decide which
            themes you want to tackle first.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            These are the ones that inspire you, can be developed into a series, or simply
            have the most topics.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Choose the Best Stories</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            Having your top themes selected, you can now start to think of your story arc.
            This is how you establish a logical structure for which stories best represent
            the selected theme.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The selection and priority of these stories will ultimately form how the
            overall narrative will flow within each theme.
          </p>

          <h3 class="lesson-detail__intro-sub-heading">Establish an Order</h3>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            The final step in the process is establishing the order you will tell these
            stories in.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It is a list, divided by theme, of episode topics that you, and by extension
            your audience, will find the most compelling.
          </p>

          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            It is also your roadmap to creating recording session schedules, detailed
            scripts, teasers, and what you should be working on next for all your
            episodes.
          </p>
          <p class="lesson-detail__intro-info">
            By the end of the process a collection of reliable sources and a schedule of
            episodes that connect with your purpose and your target audience.
          </p>
