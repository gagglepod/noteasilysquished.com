          <p class="extras-detail__info">
            In BREWTALLY WRECKED, Part 1 of Three-Minute Joe, retired Admiral Moose and
            Senior Chief Kittyhawk, co-owners of the Three-Minute Joe coffee shop, are
            thrust into a battle for survival and revenge after being named "Best Coffee
            in America." Their debate over selling Moose's award-winning "Four Horsemen"
            recipe to corporate giant Bizzlebean is interrupted by a break-in, revealing a
            plot to steal the secret recipe. The situation escalates when the burglars,
            including former comrade Nightmare and Bizzlebean agent Kitch, reveal a bomb
            planted in the shop. Despite their best efforts, the coffee shop is destroyed
            in an explosion, leaving the trio to grapple with their losses while
            questioning Bizzlebean’s sinister motives. With the help of Nightmare, whose
            past ties to Bizzlebean complicate matters, Moose and Kittyhawk vow to rebuild
            and strike back, while Kitch faces the wrath of his boss, Brutus, who orders
            him to eliminate Nightmare and Kittyhawk. As the fight for the "Four Horsemen"
            recipe intensifies, the stage is set for a brewing war against Bizzlebean.

          <p class="extras-detail__info">
            In BREWSTATION ZERO, Part 2 of Three-Minute Joe, Moose and Nightmare are
            captured by Penny, Nightmare’s manipulative ex, who’s now working with
            Bizzlebean. Ambushed by Penny and her goons, the duo is taken to Dr. Grinder's
            lab, where they learn the twisted plan to forcibly extract the "Four Horsemen"
            recipe from Moose's mind using the "Mind Grinder." Despite Moose’s incoherent
            ramblings and a chaotic rescue mission led by Kittyhawk and her ninja ally
            Mumbles, Penny manages to escape with crucial secrets, and Nightmare
            heroically sacrifices himself to ensure Moose and Kitty’s escape. Back at
            Bizzlebean’s headquarters, Penny tries to salvage the debacle by presenting a
            fake recipe to Brutus, who eagerly moves forward with plans to mass-produce
            the "Fifth Horseman" blend for his global domination scheme. The stakes are
            higher than ever as the battle for the recipe intensifies and the absurdity
            reaches new heights.

          <p class="extras-detail__info">
            In BREWING UP A STORM, Part 3 of Three-Minute Joe, Moose and his team face
            escalating chaos as they battle Bizzlebean’s relentless tactics. Moose, stuck
            in the V.A. hospital with a worsening heart condition, narrowly escapes a hit
            from a Space Force assassin, using his sharp wit to stall for time. Meanwhile,
            Kitty and Mumbles infiltrate a Bizzlebean coffee shop, rescuing Crowbar, a
            former Marine turned enslaved barista, and igniting a chaotic escape. As the
            trio bands together, they evade Bizzlebean’s armed barista army, with Crowbar
            unleashing his rage in a spectacular revenge spree. Back at the hospital,
            Kitty uncovers a dark conspiracy surrounding Moose’s disappearance, leading
            the team to suspect a traitor within NCIS. Meanwhile, Brutus gleefully moves
            forward with his world domination plan, now armed with Moose's final
            ingredient for the "Fifth Horseman" coffee. The stage is set for a high-stakes
            showdown as the Three-Minute Joes regroup to take on Bizzlebean's brewing
            storm.

            In BREWED AWAKENING, Part 4 of Three-Minute Joe, the Joes are thrown into a
            chaotic series of events as they race to rescue Moose and confront
            Bizzlebean’s ever-increasing threats. Mumbles, posing as an unlikely fighter,
            faces off against Mustang, now known as "Warhorse," in a disastrous
            underground fight, leading to shocking revelations about Moose’s new role as a
            Bizzlebean barista. The team interrogates Mustang, uncovering that Moose is
            trapped in Bizzlebean’s brutal barista training program, where mistakes are
            met with cruel punishments. With Moose and Nightmare fighting for survival,
            they manage a daring escape, only to find themselves trapped again in another
            Bizzlebean location, where they recruit a clueless but valuable ally,
            "Bermuda," as their comms guy. Meanwhile, Brutus, facing mounting corporate
            disasters and personal discomfort, escalates his pursuit of the rogue
            baristas, with plans to eliminate them once and for all. As the Joes regroup
            and prepare for their next move, Bizzlebean’s grip tightens, setting the stage
            for a full-blown confrontation.

            former lawyer turned ninja, leading to shocking revelations about their
            intertwined past and Mustang's fate. Meanwhile, Deuce and Crowbar are forced
            to contend with Bizzlebean's infiltration of the highest levels of government,
            questioning their own chain of command as they narrowly escape a merciless
            attack. Moose, Nightmare, and their new recruit, Connor, find themselves in
            the crossfire during a violent confrontation at a Bizzlebean coffee shop, as

            learns of Bizzlebean's sinister plan to use the Four Horsemen recipe for an

            to Bizzlebean with a high-risk infiltration mission. The team sneaks into the
            secret chip factory, but things quickly spiral into chaos when Bermuda’s mom
            is discovered and Deuce barely survives a brutal attack. As the group
            scrambles to save Deuce and escape, Bermuda’s unorthodox C-4 animal sculptures
            (the Boom Zoo) terrorize Bizzlebean forces and trigger a catastrophic
            explosion. Meanwhile, a malfunctioning Brewzerker, Brad, wreaks havoc, and it
            takes Molly’s quick thinking to disable him using nothing but a spoon. With
            the factory destroyed, the Joes regroup, but the stakes are raised when Molly
            reveals she has crucial intel on Bizzlebean’s "Fifth Horseman" project. As the
            team makes a daring escape, Brutus deals with the fallout, setting the stage
            for an even more dangerous showdown, with Zain sent to eliminate the Joes once
            and for all.
